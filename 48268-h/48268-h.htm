<h2>THE NEW IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT</h2>


<p>We call it new. Yet there is nothing new under
the sun&mdash;which statement, like most proverbs, is
but a half truth.</p>

<p>The world has always been full of irrepressible conflicts,
and will be as long as life is worth living in it&mdash;and longer.
There was one between centrifugal and centripetal force,
at the very start (assuming a start), when the star dust
began to whirl, and all that have been since have been
but differentiations from it. Old ones are between sex-instinct
and monogamy, between license and order, or
call it liberty and authority if you please, or freedom and
slavery. Sex-instinct, license, liberty, freedom are centrifugal;
monogamy, order, authority, even slavery, are
centripetal. The conflict between freedom and slavery
gave rise to the phrase The Irrepressible Conflict. It
came through Seward at the time of the Civil War.</p>

<p>That Irrepressible Conflict has been succeeded by one
which we have called new, but which, though in a comparatively
quiescent state, is older than Jack Cade or
even than Cleon. It took its start in the fact that in
human evolution, from the pithecanthropos up, some of
us have not got along as fast as others. Primitively, the
conflict began by those in front enslaving those behind&mdash;the
minority enslaving the majority. But that built
Athens; and with it, civilization&mdash;as we regard it. (This
starting point is selected somewhat arbitrarily, but most
starting points must be.) It now looks, though, as if the
boot were getting on the other leg&mdash;the majority trying
to enslave the minority; and if they do before humanity
is much farther evolved, what Athens started will stop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
But probably the result of the conflict will not be as bad as
that. Something like it has happened at times, however&mdash;say
when Southern Europe was rolled over by
Northern Europe, and when the Paris that had breeches
was rolled over by the Paris that had none; and possibly
something like it began when Americans that had three
thousand dollars a year and found work for the rest of the
people, and paid wages, and bought the produce of the
soil, and made commerce and finance and the best in
statecraft and science and letters and the arts&mdash;when in
two instances these men were legislated away from powers
and immunities granted to others.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all human conditions, the difference among men in
capacities, and consequently in possessions, is perhaps the
most troublesome; and yet it is because of that very condition,
that most men have done most of the things that
raised them from the lowest savagery. The progress of
the world, as a whole, has depended upon the superior
man leading the way, and upon the mass of men working
to keep up with him. Of course we in our wisdom can
ask why it was necessary to evolve men at different rates,
thus imposing upon most of us the pains of inferiority
and envy, and the strains of emulation. We don't
know, but so it is. Life is full of such paradoxes, way
down to the existence side by side of free will and necessity;
and the only effective way of life is to devote to each
of the opposing conditions the best action our little intellects
can direct, without wasting them over vain efforts
at reconciliations that are beyond us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although the wage-earner of to-day is better off than
the kings of yore in every particular except that there are
more men for him to envy, that particular is a constant
source of unhappiness to him, and is rapidly making him
a constant source of unhappiness to everybody else. The
man behind is getting more and more in conflict with
the man in front. Until lately the disturbances have been
local and spasmodic. Now they have become nation-wide
and world-wide; and until evolution has got so near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
its goal of equilibration that the differences between men
are much less than now, and the sympathies much greater,
the conflict will be irrepressible.</p>

<p>The differences from which it springs were, as is well
known, much less among the ancestors who shaped our
government than they are among ourselves. Leaving out
the slaves who did nothing in that work, the population
was nearer homogeneous in wealth and race than it is now,
and the differences were not so great as to cause much
conflict. There was virtually no proletariat. In those
days it took character to emigrate to these shores: in
these days, it almost seems to take character not to. The
nation consisted then almost entirely of farmers and land-owners,
and there continued some sort of basis for all the
talk of equality, until the proletariat "tasted blood" in
the greenbacks issued as a war measure. The impression
brought by them into the minds of the ignorant, and
fostered by the demagogues, was that to make everybody
rich, it was only necessary to print more. This delusion
dropped into the minds of the first proletariat in the world
which had long enjoyed common-school education, and
in that soil it grew rapidly, and whenever put down in
one form, it has arisen in another. When people were
satisfied that the millennium could not be brought about
by greenbacks, they felt certain, under the instruction of
that eminent financier our present Secretary-of-State,
that it could be brought about by silver. When they
got through playing with that delusion, they were entirely
ready to welcome a flood of other delusions which had
found their principal sources in Europe among men denied
the electoral franchise. Up to that time the toy of political
equality had kept the American proletariat sufficiently
amused to prevent their paying much attention to the
socialism, anarchism and similar "isms" which had agitated
the same classes abroad. But the essential conditions
had all the while been the same here, and the assassination
of McKinley illustrated that the great republic
was at last as far along in a certain sort of "progress" as
the older civilizations. It was the direct consequence of
the crazy doctrines preached all the way from Emma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Goldman up to some of the most "progressive" of the
college professors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But however discouraging the situation among the
wage-earners may be, it is perhaps better than one of ox-like
content. The average man is beginning to have
ideals&mdash;not very high ideals; most of them concern
merely his back and his belly; but there are a few which
find vent in the orchestras and dramatic efforts at the
settlements and village halls; and in the bandstands on
the village greens, horrible as generally are the noises
made in them. But these awakening ideals also appear in
the boycotts among the Danbury hatters, in the vandalisms
of the I. W. W., in the Los Angeles dynamiting,
and in murders among the Chicago teamsters and Pennsylvania
miners, as well as in the assassination of McKinley.</p>

<p>Then there is an intermediate showing of them, neither
in art nor in physical force, but in the opinions behind the
force, in all sorts of schemes toward the material basis
of enlarged life. The people seek short cuts across the
gulf, and follow like sheep those who promise them what
they want. Just as Jack Cade promised them that every
pint pot should hold a quart, so Bryan promised them,
virtually, that silver should be as good as gold, and Roosevelt
virtually promised them that all judges should be
afraid to decide against them in industrial conflicts. True,
he explains all that away in the Hibbert Journal. But
the people he harangues do not read the Hibbert Journal,
and he is astute enough to know it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Irrepressible
Conflict is where it is not between two sides wanting the
same dollars, but between the real and the ideal. Nearly
all the schemes are ideal, eminently desirable, but utterly
impossible in any state of human nature that we know or
can clearly foresee. Yet they appeal to the sympathies of
all, and therefore mislead the judgments of many. We
wish we felt as certain as we do of sunrise that in the
present stage of American evolution democratic government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
is not one of these ideals; but we cannot. The
American people has just passed its first two measures of
distinct and unqualified class legislation, and has been
running wild after the two greatest demagogues in history.
But fortunately as they both promise substantially the
same things&mdash;"steal each other's clothes," they tend to
neutralize each other.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sources of the most pronounced conflict between
facts and ideals are that ordinarily a man cannot have
more than he creates and conserves; that the desire to
will torture those who create and conserve little, as long
as they have to look upon others who create and conserve
much; and that, as long as the difference lasts, those who
have little will want to get hold of what is held by those
who have much. The things that all men want, but few
men have. Those who have not, envy and often hate
those who have. Of late this disposition has been greatly
intensified by the multitude of rapid fortunes from the
new control of Nature and from the trusts, and the parvenu
ostentation accompanying them. It makes a difference
whether princely state surrounds the king's son,
or one's own pal of yesterday.</p>

<p>Worst of all, so many of these fortunes have been obtained
wrongfully that they intensify the impression that
<i>all</i> fortunes above the average have.</p>

<p>Now the fundamental question in this conflict is: to
whom does that money rightfully belong? Among wise
people who are not economists, the width and profundity
of the ignorance on this point tends to dissipate the current
skepticism regarding the miraculous.</p>

<p>The fortunes wrongfully acquired are exceptional and
abnormal. Nearly all comfortable fortunes come from
legitimate industry. Within a generation the economists
have got the question of to whom they rightfully belong,
into the qualitative stage of settlement. The quantitative
stage is a much nicer and more complicated problem, and
varies more with different cases. Possibly the first germ
of the solution appeared a generation ago in a sentence in
Marshall's "Economics of Industry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was: "The earnings of management of a manufacturer
represent the value of the addition which his work
makes to the total product of capital and industry." The
same holds true of a farmer, miner, transporter, merchant
or anybody else who directs industry. It is more easily
recognized in the case of the inventor. Francis A. Walker
took up this theme and gradually demonstrated that so
far from the employer's profits being wrung out of the
wage-earner, they are generally greatest where wages
are highest, and proceed from devices and economies effected
by the employer, and would not exist without them.
This is being constantly illustrated by some employers
succeeding where others have failed, and failing where
others have succeeded. In support of the general thesis
Walker says: "Discussions in Economics and Statistics,"
(Vol. I., pp. 367-75):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Looking at the better employers of whatever grade ...
we note that they pay wages, as a rule, equal to those paid by
those employers who realize no profits, or even sustain a loss;
and that, indeed, if regularity of employment be taken, as it
should be, into account, the employers of the former class pay
really higher wages than the latter class. We note, further,
that the successful men of business pay as high prices for materials
and as high rates of interest for the use of capital, if the
scale of their transactions and the greater security of payment
be taken, as it should be, into account.</p>

<p>"Whence, then, comes the surplus which is left in the hands
of the higher grades of employers, after the payment of wages,
the purchase of materials and supplies, the repair and renewal
of machinery and plant? I answer, This surplus, in the case of
any employer, represents that which he is able to produce over
and above what an employer of the lowest industrial grade can
produce with equal amounts of labor and capital. In other
words, this surplus is of his own creation, produced wholly by
that business ability which raises him above and distinguishes
him from, the employers of what may be called the no-profits
class.</p>

<p>"... The excess of produce which we are contemplating comes
from directing force to its proper object by the simplest and
shortest ways; from saving all unnecessary waste of materials
and machinery; from boldly incurring the expense&mdash;the often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
large expense&mdash;of improved processes and appliances, while
closely scrutinizing outgo and practicing a thousand petty economies
in unessential matters; from meeting the demands of
the market most aptly and instantly; and, lastly, from exercising
a sound judgment as to the time of sale and the terms of
payment. It is on account of the wide range among the employers
of labor, in the matter of ability to meet these exacting
conditions of business success, that we have the phenomenon,
in every community and in every trade, in whatever state of
the market, of some employers realizing no profits at all, while
others are making fair profits; others, again, large profits;
others, still, colossal profits. Side by side, in the same business,
with equal command of capital, with equal opportunities, one
man is gradually sinking a fortune, while another is doubling
or trebling his accumulations....</p>

<p>"If this be correct, we see how mistaken is that opinion too
often entertained by the wages class, which regards the successful
employers of labor&mdash;men who realize large fortunes in manufactures
or trade&mdash;as having in some way injured or robbed
them....</p>

<p>"In this view, profits constitute no part of the price of goods,
and are obtained through no deduction from the wages of labor.
On the contrary, they are the creation of those who receive
them, each employer's profits representing that which he has
produced over and above what the employers of the lowest industrial
grade have been able to produce with equal amounts of
labor and capital."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this is now accepted doctrine among those entitled
to opinions, but as already intimated, the ignorance of it
among even people of good general intelligence is astounding,
while the laboring classes and their leaders shut their
eyes to it. No man of inferior fortune likes to admit, as
this principle asks him to, that the inferiority is in himself.
And small blame to him for his reluctance.</p>

<p>Yet to state what is usually and normally the source of
wealth, is not to claim that individual wealth never has
any other source, or to deny that it is often increased by
taking an undue advantage of inferior capacity, and by
monopoly and sundry other forms of disguised robbery.
But that wealth is <i>generally</i> the result of pillage, and not of
invention, good management and other good forces, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
probably the worst and most destructive fallacy ever
preached.</p>

<p>This destructive fallacy has seriously exaggerated the
estimates of the injustices and robberies on the part of
employers; and in the attempt to curb them, it has been
busy for many years in impeding good management, and
has cost Labor terribly in unjustifiable strikes. This,
however, is by no means saying that there are no justifiable
strikes. They are inevitably a part of the present irrepressible
conflict, but its bitterness and cruelties are
largely fed by a general feeling that wealth generally has
been accumulated at the expense of the poor, when the
truth is that generally, though not always, it has been
accumulated to their profit.</p>

<p>Yet it is far from plain how the man who tugs and
sweats should justly have little, while the man who does
not tug and sweat should justly have much. The man
who tugs and sweats saw his own hands make, or extract
from the earth or the forests or the fields, or transport
or exchange what the other man has, and no one saw
the hands of the man who has it, do anything. Naturally,
then, the man who has it not, thinks that the man
who has it, stole it&mdash;that it belongs to the man who handled
it. And he is going to take it.</p>

<p>But he is not going to take it by force: robbery he feels
to be wrong. He is going to take it "by due process of
law"&mdash;by his vote: the law has given him a vote, and
the law is justice itself. As he is in various ways permitted
to vote away other people's possessions to his own use,
he takes it for granted that he has a moral as well as a
legal right to do so to any extent, and is full of schemes
to that end. But the law has also given the other man
the property and the means of holding onto it. Here is
another outcrop of the Irrepressible Conflict: the law is in
conflict with itself. The conflict must be reconciled: the
man who wants the property must elect legislators and
judges who will change the law so the other man cannot
get the property away from the man who makes it with
his own hands, and cannot hold on to what he has already
got of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>At the outset, and to a certain extent, he is right: for
to a certain extent the principle of the greatest good of
the greatest number is unquestionably in conflict with the
principle <i>suum cuique</i>. The problem in each case is to
draw the line between these opposing forces.</p>

<p>Most of the expenses for public education, museums,
parks, public concerts, and even making, lighting and
policing streets, and of the courts and jails, have long
been paid by taxpayers mainly for the benefit of non-taxpayers,
and no one wishes these expenses stopped.
To the education in the common schools are now being
added medical supervision, care of the eyes, dentistry,
lunches, transportation to and fro. These things are not
done for the children of the people who pay most of the
money for them.</p>

<p>In still other ways, however, the poor man is increasing
through law his facilities for using the accumulations of
the rich man. As already indicated, we are just entering
upon a system of income taxation where there is not a
pretence of making the poor man pay, or even the man of
moderately comfortable means; the poor man has had
numerous statutes passed relieving from the penalties of
the common law, his conspiracies to cripple the rich man's
business if the poor man's demands are not granted; and
he has lately had wage-earners and farmers exempted
from the prosecutions under a fund for punishing conspiracies
in restraint of trade. How far can we continue
along the same road before we shall find legislation exempting
the man in need, or even fancied need, from any constraint
against taking what he wants wherever he can
find it? That legislation has now entered upon that road
seems obvious. Where is it going to stop, and what is
going to stop it?</p>

<p>Are wage-earners and farmers going to be more definitely
arrayed against the rest of the community? We
incline to think not, because the farmer, as a rule, has
property to protect, and although this legislation is in
favor of his annual income, it cannot go much farther&mdash;especially
in distributing favors elsewhere&mdash;without attacking
his accumulations. Moreover it seems impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that there should be a long continuance of the present
degree of oblivion to the desirability of having every
man feel his interest in government, through <i>some</i> degree
of the pinch of taxation.</p>

<p>Any considerable increase of the recent legislation,
would of course lead to the diminution of capital, both
through expenditure and through discouragement of accumulation.
It would also diminish the activity of those
who are able to handle capital profitably, and the consequent
effect on wages would perhaps in time become apparent
to even the order of intellect behind the legislation.</p>

<p>How far can it go without drying up the springs of
charity? There is already free talk of saving income
taxes out of charities.</p>

<p>Such legislation is certainly nursing antagonisms, and
whether the spread of general intelligence can be expected
to be rapid enough to prevent serious harm, is
doubtful. It even sometimes appears a question whether
the conflict can be settled without more serious bloodshed.
Fortunately neither side has yet as much to complain of
as one side had in the revolutions which cost Charles I
and Louis XVI their heads; and it is doubtful whether
either side has the power or coherence or disposition to
drive it to arms&mdash;whether the existing sentiment in any
civilized nation is longer such as to make such a consummation
possible. Times are growing more peaceful. Not
only has the biggest army in the world for nearly half a
century been the biggest engine of peace; not only has a
permanent international courthouse been built among the
fortresses, after several temporary ones had already done
good service; but when the brotherhood of locomotive engineers
gets into conflict with their employers, instead of
settling it in the freight yards with torches and brickbats,
both sides go to the Waldorf-Astoria and have a judicial
proceeding. For a centrifugal explosion, they substitute
a centripetal adjustment. And the brawn supplies its
share of the brains to do it.</p>

<p>The fundamental question is, of course, whether before
serious harm has been done, the differences in men's fortunes
which, as said at the outset, largely mean differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in men's powers, can be sufficiently decreased to
leave room for little conflict.</p>

<p>One answer is that the equalization is already taking
place at a rate that few people realize. Amid the poor,
the impression that the rich are growing richer and the
poor poorer, is quite general, and of course is fostered by
the demagogues who make their living out of the discontent&mdash;out
of the justifiable discontent less perhaps than
out of the unjustifiable. Worse still, perhaps, the educated
whose sympathies lead them to instruct the ignorant,
are to a shameful degree ignorant of the truth in
this regard, and, it must be feared, of the facts of the
economic situation generally: somehow the softness of
heart which actuates many such well-meaning people
seems often to accompany a softness of head which recoils
from all hard facts that would narrow the field where they
delight to exercise their sympathies.</p>

<p>Nobody will question the progress of the average man
from status to contract&mdash;from slavery, serfdom, feudal
dependence, to wage-earning; but since the time of Marx,
the claim of rich richer, and poor poorer has been general&mdash;among
the ignorant rich as well as the ignorant
poor. Nevertheless abundant authorities prove the exact
contrary.</p>

<p>In the "poor poorer" part of the assertion, there was
undeniably much truth during the early part of the nineteenth
century, especially before industry became adjusted
to the new machinery, and before the rise of the
trades unions and the overthrow of the <i>laissez-faire</i> policy
in legislation. But after those changes, there was a
rapid advance in wages, shortening of hours, and reduction
in the price of commodities. So great was the change that
even Marx himself, who had done more than any other
man to spread the "increasing misery" theory, abandoned
it in an address delivered in 1864. Yet he so
little understood the force of admissions that he then
made, that he let the elaborate <i>a priori</i> demonstration of
the theory which he had already built up, stand in his
"Capital," which he did not publish till 1867.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
admissions of 1864 did not end in theory. Facts began to
accumulate to confirm it. Early in the twentieth century
the changed conditions had attracted attention, and
there were gathered many data which proved that rapid
betterment had taken place in the condition of wage-earners.</p>

<p>We have space for but a few of the facts, and they are
not all up to date. Of the results of the Census of 1910
which bear on this subject, very few are yet published.
Most of those of the Census of 1900 were not published
till 1907, and it is only up to about that time that many
data are at the moment available. But we hope before
long to present a careful study of the conditions up to the
present time. Meanwhile, it is pleasant to note the following:</p>

<p>In the United States wages in manufacturing industries
averaged $247 in 1850, $427 in 1899, and $519 in 1909.
And of course other industries could not fall very far below
manufactures.</p>

<p>The cost of living did not begin to show any such advance.
Dun's tables show that the yearly cost of living
per capita in 1860, before the civil war, was $16.87 <i>more</i>
than in 1905. For the sixteen years 1880 to 1895, inclusive,
the average yearly cost was $101.65. For the
ten years 1896 to 1905, inclusive, the average was $81.52,
$20.13 <i>less</i> than for the earlier period. There has been a
sharp advance since 1905, but taking the whole period
from 1850 to the present time, nothing to compare with the
advance in wages.</p>

<p>Although the recent class legislation in favor of the
labor trusts also included any possible farmer trust, the
farmer appears to have progressed with the wage-earner.
His products have lately materially advanced in price,
and the abstract of the Census of 1910 says (p. 295):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The total value of the land and buildings of the 1,006,511
farms shown for 1910 was $6,330,000,000, and the amount of
debt was $1,726,000,000, or 27.3 per cent. of the value. The
corresponding proportion in 1890, as shown in the reports, was
35.5 per cent., and to make this figure strictly comparable it
would presumably have to be increased slightly. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
thus during the 20 years a marked diminution in the relative
importance of mortgage debt ... but the average owner's
equity per farm increased from $2,220 to $4,574, or more than
doubled.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wholesale clothing dealers report a great increase in
average size and quality of clothes demanded, which shows
that the people are better fed and exercised and better off.
Over all highly civilized countries the consumption of food
has been increasing faster than population. This cannot
mean that the rich eat and drink more; for they ate and
drank all they wanted before: so it must prove that the
proportion of those who can eat and drink freely is increasing.</p>

<p>Moreover, hours of labor have been decreasing without
any diminution of production. The United States Labor
Bureau reports for 1913 show that the average wage-earner
is working shorter hours than ever before, that he
is receiving more pay for the short-hour week than he
formerly received for the long-hour week, and that the
increase in his average wage in most industries has been
so great that its purchasing power has risen, notwithstanding
the increase in prices of many commodities.</p>

<p>As to the "rich richer" fallacy: in Massachusetts for
the period 1829-31 the probated estates under $5,000
were 85.6 per cent. of the whole, in the period 1889-91
they had fallen to 69.5 of the whole. It is nevertheless
true that a few of the rich are richer than men have been
before, and in the case of an increasing proportion of them,
it has been for the good of all of us.</p>

<p>In Great Britain from 1840 to 1890, the number of
estates subject to succession tax increased twice as fast
as population, while the average amount per estate had
not increased at all.</p>

<p>In France from 1853 to 1883 wages advanced some
sixty per cent., and in the principal occupations of women
(outside of domestic service), they nearly doubled.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Mallock, after an elaborate investigation
in the British Census reports, the details of which are
given in his "Classes and Masses," states the following
conclusions: "The poor" (except those who have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
at all) "are getting richer; the rich, on an average, getting
poorer ... and of all classes in the community, the
middle class is growing the fastest." Since 1830 the population
has increased "in the proportion of 27 to 35; the
increase of the section in question [the middle class] was
in the proportion of 27 to 84." "The middle class has
increased numerically in the proportion of 3 to 10; the
rich class has increased only in the proportion of 3 to 8."
In 1881, there were seven thousand windowless cabins
occupied by families in Scotland; by 1891, these had
"almost disappeared; the one-roomed dwellings with
windows have decreased 25 per cent.; the two-roomed
dwellings have <i>increased</i> by 8 per cent., and the three-roomed
and four-roomed dwellings by 17 per cent."</p>

<p>In 1815 there were 100,000 paupers in London. At the
rate of increase of population in 1875, there should have
been 300,000. There actually were less than 100,000,
while from 1871 to 1908 the percentage of population
"relieved" fell from 31 to 22.</p>

<p>In Germany, income-tax statistics prove the same thing.
In Prussia, from 1876 to 1888, Dr. Soetbeer (quoted by
Professor Mayo-Smith) finds that the proportion of income-tax
payers with their families, to the whole population, had
increased about 22 per cent., that is from 2.3 per cent. of
the population to 2.8 per cent., and that the classes which
had increased at the most rapid rate were those with incomes
of over $500. And although the most rapid increase
of all had been in the class with incomes of over $25,000,
the average incomes of that class had decreased.</p>

<p>We regret that more recent figures than some we have
given cannot be had in time for the present article, but as
already said, we hope before long to present the results of
a special study backed by the forthcoming census bulletin,
and attempting to weigh judicially the confusing factor introduced
into the situation by that part of the rise in prices
due to the unprecedented increase in the supply of gold.
Were it not for that extraneous circumstance, the showing
for the wage-earner's advance would be even greater.</p>

<p>The very recent and probably temporary rise in prices is
principally attributed to the unprecedented production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
gold, the rush away from the farms to the cities, the rise
in wages, and certain wastes in labor. In some trades
wages have been forced to a height which, acting on the
prices of products, has in many particulars nullified the
advance in wages. All raising of wages by limiting labor
instead of increasing product, by increasing friction instead
of efficiency, by getting more than one's own instead
of making one's own larger, must raise prices. So, to
put it more in detail, must all such adventitious tricks
as limiting apprentices; limiting each laborer's speed to
that of the slowest; limiting the kinds of things a man
can reasonably do&mdash;in short, all limiting of labor below
its best efficiency by men or masters, masters remembering
of course that to best efficiency reasonable rest, food and
other good conditions are essential. So must all making
of work by putting onto a job more labor than can accomplish
it economically, as by calling a painter, a carpenter
and a plumber to do a little job that any one of
them could complete alone, and destroying good old product
to make a call for new. Under ordinary conditions
there will always be work enough for everybody without
these efforts to create work artificially, and the extraordinary
conditions where there is not enough, are only
multiplied and intensified by such efforts.</p>

<p>But despite these influences contributory to the rise
of prices in recent years, the improvements in the wage-earner's
lot that had been noted for over half a century,
have on the whole continued to the present time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the forms of industrial conflict are but manifestations
of Nature's striving for equilibration&mdash;the goal of
all evolution; and only with a nearer equilibration of men's
fortunes will there be peace. How can it be brought about?</p>

<p>Will a victory of the socialists bring it? Yes, if, by premature
action, you make a desert and call it peace, or if
you wait until the civic virtues are so far developed that
selections at the polls will be as unbiassed and discriminating
as those of Nature. But if that time is approaching,
it is with leaden feet; and to act as if it had arrived would
only delay it. Our steps must be cautious and tentative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
That the frightful wastes of both competition and monopoly
should be avoided by state management of all industries
or even to any great extent by state control, is a far-off
ideal&mdash;so far-off that men wise enough to be successful
are slow to express opinions about it. Beside this ideal,
as beside the ideal of the land directly providing the
government revenue, stalks, as the extreme fallacy generally
stalks beside the truth, the false ideal of the government
management or the land tax producing enough
revenue to take care of everybody, and doing it, leaving
to no one the saving duty of taking care of himself.</p>

<p>The steps already taken toward that ideal, it may
perhaps be worth while to glance at. Outside of government's
fundamental functions&mdash;the maintenance of order
and justice&mdash;it has also managed the post-office, the coast
and geological surveys, the currency, the census, the
public schools, the streets, and the care of the sick and
incapable. Some highly centralized and highly civilized
governments have added the railways, but the privately
owned ones, with all their shortcomings, are better; government
telegraph service has been cheapened at the
expense of the taxpayers, and government telephone
service has been abominable. All this has been non-competitive
work. There is not yet any sign that government
could make a success of competitive industries. All
the indications are the other way. Governments have
so far been too slow to invent or even adopt improvements,
especially where they involve scrapping old plant;
and so far, government has generally been an extravagant
and wasteful employer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unlike many other conflicts, the new Irrepressible
Conflict can never be settled by violence: for violence
cannot remove that difference in the capacities of men
from which the conflict arises. Violence, even violence
disguised under votes, may spasmodically lessen the natural
differences in property, but they will reappear as
long as there are differences in productive capacity, and
society secures to the individual a reasonable share of his
production. In this and all cases, advantageous exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of course is productive of additional value; and there is a
less frequent exchange which tends not to mutual increase
of fortune, but to increased difference in fortune. Should
society ever go so far as to take from the inventor, the
capital-saver, the work-finder, the work-manager and the
exchanger their share of the products which, without them,
would not exist, and which are shared in by all, production
would fall off, probably below the starvation point.</p>

<p>If, then, the conflict cannot be fought out, how is peace
to be attained, even the limited degree of peace enjoyed
before the modern unrest? Simply by reducing to a negligible
point the difference in the productive powers of men&mdash;in
their intelligence, energy and reliability; and this
by leveling up, not by leveling down, as some of the trades
unions, from noble but mistaken motives, attempt.</p>

<p>"Simply!" The general proposition is simple enough,
but there are many perplexities of detail. One inheres in
the definition of "productive powers." Probably it will
serve to call them the <i>capacities of furnishing satisfactions</i>;
and to include in satisfactions those produced for oneself
as well as those exchanged. In this sense the impecunious
philosopher has high productive powers&mdash;often so high
that he would not exchange them for those of the captain
of industry, and he does not often feel discontent enough
to make him a very active factor in the Irrepressible Conflict.
He does sometimes, though, especially when he
feels the pinch of his narrow financial income compared
with that of the producer of more material satisfactions.
As he is usually a man of gentle make-up, the effect of his
narrow income is increased by sympathy with the unfortunate,
and sometimes these combined influences send
out mighty queer doctrine from professorial chairs. Such
phenomena, however, do not controvert the general proposition
that the satisfactions of the spirit are to be included
among those upon whose more equal production
depends the disappearance of the conflict that must be
till then irrepressible.</p>

<p>There is no way to peace, then, other than increasing
the productive power of the less productive man. Sharing
with him material goods, except to tide over emergencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that his powers cannot meet, won't do the trick at all,
as has been abundantly proved, from the English poor
laws down, and as is going to be proved again before some
of our recent "progressive" legislation has run its course.</p>

<p>This is far from saying, however, that legislation really
progressive in this direction is impossible. We for our
part, however, do not see as much hope in legislation as in
improvement in knowledge and understanding and disposition
among people generally. That great improvement
in disposition may be near at hand, seems indicated
by recent experiences among the most revolutionary and
suggestive in human annals. The recent meeting at
Gettysburg, not to speak of the minor earlier ones at
Lookout Mountain and elsewhere, indicates an advance
in human nature so immense that it has not been realized.
Not the least significant thing it demonstrated, is the vast
decrease in the necessity of wasting thousands of lives and
billions of treasure to settle differences of opinion.</p>

<p>As this is now so startlingly indicated regarding the
Irrepressible Conflict which culminated at Gettysburg,
and which <i>could</i> be settled by force, is there not even
much more reason to hope for a settlement not very remote,
by methods of reason, of our new Irrepressible
Conflict, which <i>cannot</i> be settled by force?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But even if the outcroppings of the conflict are so soon
settled, the fundamental conflict will persist as long as
the difference in men is so great, and that difference is
the most important thing to be dealt with by all lovers
of peace and humanity. The only way to cancel it is for
the men in front to help those behind, and for those behind
to help themselves&mdash;to everything that does not belong
to somebody else.</p>

<p>But those in front are entitled to have their judgments
followed where they are not plainly tainted by self-interest,
and it will pay them to keep self-interest out of
their judgments so far as self-preservation does not demand
it. But how much self-preservation can properly
cover, is a difficult question, and space permits little more
than the suggestion of it. Shall a man's self rightly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a wearer of but one suit of clothes, an occupant of a hut,
an eater of the plainest food, and an entertainer of no
guests: or shall his self rightly be clothed beautifully and
suitably for all occasions, occupy a house that shall be a
pleasure to gaze upon, consume the food essential to both
the greatest refinement and the greatest efficiency, dispense
a generous hospitality, broaden his mind and develop
his taste so that he can enlighten and inspire others, encourage
letters and the arts, and have leisure to devote to
charities, education and the common good? There are
plenty of illustrations that a man may preserve a self as
large as this&mdash;as large as Goethe's or Marcus Aurelius's&mdash;and
yet issue no advice unworthy of the respect of smaller
men, and be of an advantage to the race beside which the
cost of maintaining such a self is nothing.</p>

<p>If most men cannot have the things just enumerated,
and if many of those who have them abuse them, is it best
that none should have them? That all should have them
is, in the present stage of human development, impossible.
If all the wealth of the United States were divided equally
among us, we would have but a little over $1,300 apiece,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and much of it would be wasted at once, and no conceivable
laws would prevent what might be left, being in a
very short time as unevenly distributed as now. The
only glimpse we can see of a time of even fortunes, is
of a time of even capacities; and the only rational way
we can see to such a time is through helping each other:
every other experiment toward it has proved illusive.</p>

<p>The principal roots of the difficulty are generalized as
ignorance and incompetence. The ignorance has already
been strongly, though very blunderingly, attacked in the
public schools, but not much more blunderingly perhaps
than in the universities. It is a strange paradox that education,
though the special care of the educated, should be
among the most backward of the arts, yet so the highest-educated
are the first to admit it to be. We are making
hopeful progress in it, though, and are rapidly developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
it to care for incompetence not only in mind but in body
and disposition.</p>

<p>Then in the struggles of wage-earners and wage-payers,
the principle of arbitration is certainly making rapid inroads
on the practice of violence. The settlement of the
recent great railroad controversies was by deliberative
assemblies, not by mobs.</p>

<p>The farther lessening of the difference in material possessions
by leveling down on one side as well as leveling
up on the other, has lately become a very real and active
question. While the inventor has seldom realized his
share of production, and while the average director of
industry has seldom realized more than his, undoubtedly
extortionists and monopolists have rolled up fortunes out
of all proportion to their deserts; and the regulation of
these, though not doing much to fill up the differences,
will do more to relieve the spirit of discontent.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how much of the share now
going to the employer can go to the employee without
stopping the employer's functions of finder, organizer
and director of profitable work. We cannot intelligently
foresee conditions in which these functions on his part will
not be absolutely essential to the progress of society.
The functions, however, are being more and more performed,
even under the trusts, by men rising from the
ranks; and even the men remaining in the ranks are probably
performing more and more of those same functions,
though some of the short-sighted policies of the unions
are obstructing them.</p>

<p>And the unions themselves, despite policies not yet
outgrown, have unquestionably done much to raise the
wage-earners' fortunes, and are probably, with more
experience and wider outlook, to do vastly more. But
not until they get beyond the policy of holding their
own best men back, will they enter on their full career,
and then their least effective men will most benefit.
Moreover, the wisest and most effective men are those
most ready to learn from criticism, and when the unions
realize it, they will have another avenue to usefulness.
They will be helped to realize it, however, by more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
patience, candor and disinterestedness on the part of the
critics. So far, everybody is bellicose, as first at Gettysburg.
Cannot both sides to the present Irrepressible Conflict
better anticipate a conciliatory disposition than did
those heroes of fifty years ago?</p>

<p>When we can always carry the Irrepressible Conflict
into courts and arbitrations and, as Godkin said, substitute
for the shock of battle, the shock of trained intellects,
peace will be in sight.</p>

<p>Its first essential is always a clear understanding.
There are lies somewhere in every human conflict. Probably
the most pitiful and pernicious of all lies is that all
men are equal. The only remedy is to make it true.</p>

<h2>THE MAJORITY JUGGERNAUT</h2>


<p>During the past five years the agitation in favor of
so modifying our governmental system as to remove
all those barriers which stand between the will of
the majority and its immediate execution has attained
formidable dimensions. That the defects which American
government has exhibited in many directions have been
so serious and so persistent as to furnish great justification
for this agitation no candid observer can deny. In both of
the two ways upon which advocates of the initiative and
referendum lay so much stress, our representative institutions
have indeed sadly failed of being ideally representative.
Venality of individual legislators, or the control of
whole bodies of them by corrupt bosses, has resulted in
innumerable instances of special legislation for the benefit
of powerful private interests and contrary to the interests
of the people. And it must be admitted that apart from
any question of venality or corruption there has often been
a degree of inertia in the enactment of enlightened and
progressive legislation which cannot be ascribed to legitimate
conservatism, but must be set down either to the
unfitness of legislatures for their responsibilities or to obstacles
which an extreme interpretation of constitutional
restraints has unnecessarily put in its way.</p>

<p>Nor can it be denied that the referendum and the initiative
have intrinsic value as remedies adapted to the
counteracting of these two evils respectively. Given a
legislature owned by special interests, or controlled by a
boss, its power to give away valuable franchises or otherwise
to squander the people's inheritance can be held in
check by the requirement that upon proper demand such
action shall be rendered subject to a veto by the people at
large. And if, owing to the intricacies of party organization
or to other circumstances, a legislature is stubbornly
obstructive, the initiation of legislation by means of popular
petition undeniably offers an instrument for the overcoming
of such inertia. Were it true that the control of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
legislatures by private interests is on the increase, or even
showing no sign of diminution; were it true that legislation
for social betterment is making little or no headway;
were it true that our courts show no disposition to realize
that a more liberal interpretation of constitutional provisions
is demanded by the changed conditions of our time;
it would probably be admitted by all except a few irreconcilables
that, however serious might be the objections
to the remedies proposed, their adoption appears to be
almost dictated by that kind of imperious necessity that
knows no law.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the diametrical opposite of these
things is what, upon a large survey of the state of the whole
country, is unmistakably evident. It is doubtful whether
one can point anywhere to a legislature owned as the
Pennsylvania legislature used to be owned by the Pennsylvania
Railroad, the Maryland legislature by the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad, the New Hampshire legislature
by the Boston and Maine Railroad. Child labor laws
and workmen's compensation laws are being enacted and
strengthened in state after state, very much after the
fashion in which the Australian ballot laws were being
passed in state after state a quarter of a century ago. And
as for our courts, the Supreme Court of the United States,
once regarded as the very stronghold of extreme constitutionalism,
has been steadily setting an example of liberal
construction; while such a decision as that of the New
York Court of Appeals in the Ives case is pointed to on all
hands as being rather in the nature of a survival of a past
attitude of mind than typical of the present temper of the
courts of last resort in our leading states.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, enough remains, and more than enough,
to constitute a serious grievance. The progress that has
been made towards the removal of scandalous practices
or exasperating impotence is not sufficient to justify complacency.
But it is sufficient to dispose of that plea of
desperate necessity to which advocates of the "rule of the
people" are so prone to resort as over-riding all other considerations.
Indeed, the state of mind of these advocates
is in no small measure an illustration of that remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
psychological phenomenon to which Herbert Spencer has
drawn attention as marking the progress of reform agitations&mdash;that
their excitement usually becomes most intense
when the object to which they are directed has been
almost attained. A dozen years ago it might plausibly
have been urged that in our existing representative institutions
effective control of public service corporations was
impossible; but the railroad-rate legislation of the national
Congress and the institution of Public Service Commissions
in state after state have been accomplished without
a jar. A few years ago it was still the fashion to speak of
the United States Constitution as virtually incapable of
amendment, this belief being based on the fact that, apart
from the amendments brought about by the Civil War,
none had been adopted since the early days of the republic.
The adoption of the sixteenth and seventeenth amendments
in rapid succession has disposed of that notion for
good and all; and yet it is only now that a proposal to
substitute an easy and rapid method of amendment in
place of that now provided in the Constitution has been
brought forward and urged. Indeed, it is hardly too much
to say that to-day's impatience with our existing governmental
system, to-day's readiness to welcome short-cut
remedies, is attributable rather to exasperation with the
difficulties and evils of yesterday than to the conditions of
to-day or the prospects of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Into the merits and defects of the various proposals for
"direct rule of the people" it is not the purpose of this
brief paper to enter in detail. Many valid considerations
have been urged in their favor, and many sound objections
have been advanced against them. Speaking generally,
these arguments relate to the question of the honesty, intelligence,
and efficiency of legislation as it has been, or is
likely to be, affected by the change in question. Advocates
of the new order have pointed to the well-known deficiencies
of our legislatures as they are. Its opponents
have given instances of errors, and of the misleading of
voters, under the initiative system. In the main, however,
since experience&mdash;in spite of Switzerland's long, but
sparing, use of the method&mdash;has as yet been but of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
slightest extent, serious writers on both sides have dwelt
chiefly on the inherent tendency of the system. That it
cannot cover the whole province of legislation both sides
are fully agreed; and objectors lay chief stress on the inevitable
tendency of the initiative-and-referendum system
to reduce the importance and dignity of legislatures and
consequently to end all hope of raising the quality of their
membership, while advocates of the system set great store
by the educative value of the exercise of direct legislative
judgment upon the whole body of the citizenship.</p>

<p>There is, however, one consideration, and that perhaps
the most vital of all, which appears to have been strangely
neglected. Every-day efficiency, even every-day right-mindedness,
is not the only thing about which there is
occasion for solicitude. It seems usually to be forgotten on
both sides of the discussion that there occur every now
and then, in the history of a nation, questions of a crucial
nature upon the right or wrong decision of which rest
momentous and enduring consequences. Such questions,
under the traditions of representative government as they
have grown up in the course of ages, are fought out in a
very different way from that which marks the ordinary
routine of legislation and government. They are not settled
by an instantaneous show of hands. What may take
place in England if it shall come to be governed by a single
chamber and under a closure system which makes parliamentary
obstruction impossible, no man can say; but
up to the present time nothing like this kind of unlimited
rule by majority vote in a parliamentary body has existed
either in that country or in our own. There has always
been in both a possibility of resistance, in one form or another,
to the immediate desire of a majority of the people's
representatives; and this has profoundly affected the
course of history upon those matters which are of most
vital moment.</p>

<p>The difference between questions of this type and the
ordinary subjects of every-day legislation is more than a
mere difference of degree. It is not only that they are
more momentous; they are different in kind, in that their
decision involves a result which, humanly speaking, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
irreversible. Nothing is more common than to say that if
an act of the people should prove to be a mistake, they
will correct that mistake. But there are mistakes that
cannot be corrected. If the question of union or disunion
had been put to the touch of a majority vote, and had been
decided in favor of disunion, the result of that one day's
voting would, in all human probability, have been a permanent
severance of this nation into two mutually alien
parts. Since the Civil War there has been one great issue
which, though in a wholly different way, quite as distinctly
illustrates the irrevocable character which the decision
of a public question may have. It <i>might</i> be no calamity
for this country to live, either temporarily or permanently,
under a silver standard. But the truly vital point in the
silver question which occupied the attention of the nation
for twenty years was not that of the silver standard as
such, but of the repudiation and currency-debasement
involved in substituting the silver dollar, at the ratio of
sixteen to one, for the gold dollar as the monetary unit.
Had this substitution been effected, the repudiation and
debasement would have taken place; and a subsequent
return to the gold standard would not in the slightest degree
have redressed the wrong. Under the existing system
of government there was opportunity for obstruction, for
compromise, for the effective influence of a few strong
minds and a few powerful personalities. Under the "direct
rule of the people" the whole matter might have been
settled at a stroke; and it is by no means improbable that
it would have been so settled, at some stage or other of the
struggle, in favor of the silver standard. For it must be
remembered that the very existence of this possibility
would have stimulated in an incalculable degree the efforts
of the silver agitators; and nothing is more probable
than that during the years of depression, distress, and discontent
that followed upon the panic of 1893, a moment
would have been found when the popular cry of "more
money" would have swept the country.</p>

<p>That questions not less fundamental, and the decision
of which is not less irrevocable, are destined to arise in the
future it should be unnecessary to argue. Never, in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
country at least, has the atmosphere been so charged with
issues affecting the very bases of the economic and social
order. These issues are for the most part vague and undefined,
but their gravity and sweep is none the less apparent.
But if an illustration were needed of a more specific nature,
and one which relates to a question partly of the past and
partly of the future, such an illustration lies ready to
hand. The agitation against the right of private property
in land which was started forty years ago by Henry
George's "Progress and Poverty" has only within the last
few years become a serious factor in practical politics.
The shape which it assumes in the actual proposals urged
for immediate adoption is that of a mere reduction of the
tax now levied on buildings and the placing of a corresponding
additional tax on land. But the earnest advocates
of this step and its earnest opponents alike rest their
case on the animating purpose behind it. That purpose
flows from the conviction, which its leading advocates
often find it politic to keep in the background but which
they seldom disavow, that the owners of land have no
rights which, in the eye of justice, the rest of the community
is bound to respect. The fiery zeal that shines through
the pages of "Progress and Poverty" is animated by this
conviction on the one hand, and on the other by the unhesitating
belief that under the regime of private property in
land human wretchedness must continually increase, while
its abolition would carry with it the extinction of poverty.
Henry George did not balk at the word confiscation. Indeed
it is precisely the assertion of the right to confiscate
land which, apart from the eloquent and plausible presentation,
constituted the distinctive character of George's
work. John Stuart Mill had long advocated the interception
by the state of the "unearned increment" of the
future, but firmly held that expropriation of landowners
without compensation is morally indefensible. Henry
George, in spite of his profound reverence for Mill, dismissed
this judgment of the great liberal economist and
philosopher with undisguised contempt. After quoting a
certain passage from Mill, George exclaims:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>In the name of the Prophet&mdash;figs! If the land of any
country belong to the people of that country, what right, in
morality and justice, have the individuals called landowners to
the rent? If the land belong to the people, why in the name of
morality and justice should the people pay its salable value for
their own?</p></blockquote>

<p>But while Henry George was convinced that outright
confiscation would be perfectly just, he proposed to accomplish
the substance of confiscation without introducing its
form. "Confiscation," he said, "would involve a needless
shock to present customs and habits of thought;" and
the method he proposed for achieving his end was "to
abolish all taxation save that upon land values." But he
made no pretence whatever of there being any difference
in substance between the two things. It was of the essence
of his plan that the single tax should be tantamount to
confiscation. The mere placing of the present entire burden
of taxation upon the landowners would be far from
sufficing for his purpose; and he expressly counted on
what he regarded as the inevitable and rapid growth of the
land tax, when once his principle was acknowledged, to
such dimensions as to swallow up the entire rental value of
land. Not the mere expenses of government as we are now
familiar with them, but all the outlay for social and individual
betterment which the entire revenue now attaching
to the ownership of land could supply was to be available
for the public good. The idea of his program was
epigrammatically, but sufficiently accurately, conveyed in
a motto that was prominent in his campaign for mayor of
New York: "No taxes at all, and a pension for everybody."</p>

<p>Now it requires no extraordinary effort of the fancy to
imagine what would be the natural course of such an agitation
as this under a system of government in which the
idea of the direct rule of the people had become thoroughly
established; and by "thoroughly established" we
must understand, in the case of our own country, the dominance
of that idea in the nation as well as in the separate
States. If in those conditions a doctrine like that of
Henry George were put forward, and commanded the devotion
of a band of earnest and able men, the form which
its propaganda would take would, in the nature of things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
be wholly different from that which we have actually
witnessed. The goal towards which all effort would be
directed would be the obtaining of a popular majority for
some single proposal, the adoption of which would insure
the fulfilment of the great purpose. The preoccupation of
the nation with other issues that divide parties or factions
would be no hindrance. In order to bring the question up
for immediate decision by popular vote, all that would be
necessary would be the satisfaction of some minimum requirement
laid down in the initiative system; a minimum
requirement which, be it noted, under the principle of
"direct rule," has for its only <i>raison d'être</i> the practical
need of avoiding an intolerable multiplication of election
questions. With this minimum satisfied, the champions of
the change would advance to the charge year after year,
fired with the consciousness that the gaining of a popular
majority at the very next election would end once for all
the iniquitous institution by which mankind has been
robbed of its birthright, and make poverty and wretchedness
a thing of the past.</p>

<p>But, it may be objected, is there after all any essential
difference between this process and that which goes on
under the traditional representative system, when it is
truly representative? If the people are really convinced
that land ownership is robbery, and that they should
resume what they hold to be their own, are they not able,
and ought they not to be able, to obtain their wish through
the legislative assembly which represents them? The answer
is that under the representative system as we know
it&mdash;and quite as much at its best as at its worst&mdash;the
influence of the wishes of the electorate upon the representative
body is not uniform and mechanical. Representatives
are elected not upon one issue, but upon many,
and it is always a question how definite the popular "mandate"
has been upon any one of them. From this alone
it follows that there is a large, though indefinite, region
in which a representative may feel free to act according
to the dictates of his own individual judgment. In the
case of any question involving a fundamental and momentous
change, it is necessary that the mandate be extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
clear before it can be regarded by intelligent and conscientious
legislators as binding upon them; and to accomplish
this the strength of the feeling among the people in
favor of the measure must be shown in ways far more emphatic,
far more conclusive of a firm and fixed desire,
than the mere existence of a majority vote. The issue
must virtually raise itself to a prominence and intensity
commensurate with its importance. It must find its way
not merely to a position in which, when people are challenged
to say yes or no, a few more say yes than say no,
but to a position in which it dominates other issues and is
seen to represent the deliberate and imperative desire of
the people. And when we add to this the constitutional
checks that have thus far obtained both in England and
in this country, together with the legitimate possibilities
of parliamentary obstruction, we see how profound is the
difference between the representative system and that of
direct rule. It may almost be likened to the difference
between a living organism, endowed with the power of
discrimination and judgment, and a crude mechanical
contrivance. In the one case, a great issue has to go
through an ordeal fitted to its nature; in the other, it is put
into the hopper along with the veriest trifles of every-day
business, and its fate is settled by the same monotonous
turn of the wheel.</p>

<p>The difference which I have been endeavoring to bring
out is not identical either with the difference between
conservatism and progressiveness or the difference between
carefulness and looseness in legislation. Much has been
said both for and against "direct rule" as related to these
qualities; it has been contended that direct legislation is
more conservative and less conservative, more prone to
error and less prone to error, than legislation by representative
assemblies. But what is usually held in view,
on both sides, is the course of what I have been referring
to as every-day legislation. Important, however, as the
question may be in relation to such matters, the transcendent
issue involved in the question of direct rule of
the people is how it would operate in those supreme trials
which the nation is sure to be called upon in the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as it has been in the past, to undergo. The cardinal objection
that I find to it is not that it is radical or that it is
careless, but that it is intrinsically incapable of making
that vital distinction which should be made between these
grand issues and the ordinary questions of legislative
routine. And no merely mechanical modification would
overcome this difficulty. The influences which, upon great
occasions, have been brought into play to stay the flood
of immediate popular desire perform a function for which
no automatic device can serve as a substitute. These influences
are sometimes noble, as in Cleveland's adamantine
resistance to currency debasement, or in the act
of the seven Republican Senators who, at tragic cost to
themselves, voted against the conviction of Andrew Johnson;
sometimes ignoble, as in the gigantic campaign fund
raised by Mark Hanna in 1896; sometimes not specially
to be marked with any moral label, but embodying the
weight naturally accorded, in any system except that of
the absolute and mechanical rule of the majority, to intellectual
ability and personal force as such. Under the
system of direct rule of the people, all possibility of such
interposition would be swept away. Union or disunion,
currency debasement or currency integrity, land confiscation
or the observance of the rights of property&mdash;issues
like these could be brought before the people with the
same facility as a measure authorizing the purchase of a
toll-road or defining the duties of a sheriff; and their fate
would be decided by the same simple yes or no of the
majority.</p>

<p>Opponents of direct rule are more or less in the habit of
speaking of it as the rule of the mob. Its advocates have
no trouble in disposing of this characterization by pointing
out that the distinguishing mark of a mob is disorder
or lawlessness, while the process of taking a vote of the
people, on measures even more than on men, is eminently
orderly and regular. The phrase is open to objection;
taken literally, it cannot be defended. But in all probability
what those who use it really mean, more or less distinctly,
is something very like what has been dwelt on in
this paper. What they have in mind is not the turbulence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of the mob, but its brute power, its inaccessibility to complex
considerations, its incapacity for taking counsel or
modifying its purpose, the dumb finality of its acts. A
system under which the highest questions of fundamental
public policy were submitted to the peremptory decision
of a majority vote at the polls would be so vitally different
from the system of representative government as we have
known it that, allowance made for the picturesque exaggeration
of the figure, the likening of it to mob rule is by
no means without excuse.</p>

<p>There are of course many advocates of the initiative
and referendum who qualify their support in various
ways; and, so far as that goes, there are many opponents
who admit that, within proper limitations, these methods
may be desirable. With all this I am not concerned. The
real force behind the general movement&mdash;including not
only direct legislation but also the recall of judges and the
nullification of judicial decisions by popular vote&mdash;is the
dogma of the inherent rightfulness of the unlimited rule of
the majority. In the collection of papers on the subject
issued by the American Academy of Political and Social
Science, the leading place is given to a paper by Senator
Bourne, of Oregon. Of any hesitation as to the application
of the direct legislation method to the irreversible decision
of fundamental questions, he shows not the faintest trace.
On the contrary, it is precisely to questions of the highest
moment, to the decision of issues of great sweep and significance,
that he regards the application of the direct vote
as peculiarly just and desirable. "It is not proposed," he
says, "that the people shall act directly in all the intricate
details of legislation." The great function of the initiative
is in the field of ideas: "Under the initiative any man can
secure the submission of his ideas to a vote of all the people,
provided eight per cent. of the people sign a petition asking
that the measure he proposes be so submitted." That
any such question, so submitted, will be decided as it
should be, Senator Bourne not only does not doubt, but
apparently does not imagine that anybody else can be so
perverse as to doubt. "The people of a state will never
vote against their own interests, hence they will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
vote to adopt a law unless it proposes a change for the improvement
of the general welfare." No sign of consciousness
that there may be a difference between the interests
of the majority and the interests of the whole people, between
immediate interests and permanent interests, between
apparent interests and real interests; still less of any
possible conflict between interests&mdash;as that word is commonly
understood&mdash;and the abiding principles of justice
or of honor. The 300,000 are certain to be right if the
count of noses against them is but 290,000. To be sure,
no rational man can actually believe this; and there is
little doubt that Senator Bourne would repudiate such an
interpretation of his words. But there is equally little
doubt as to the position he would fall back upon. "The
chief function"&mdash;this is the declaration with which he
opens his discussion&mdash;"the chief function of the initiative
and referendum is to restore the absolute sovereignty of
the people." The idea that the sovereignty of the people
means absolute and unrestricted rule over the whole people
according to the immediate will and pleasure of fifty-one
per cent. of the people&mdash;a crude error whose almost
unchallenged currency among the "progressives" of our
day is one of the most remarkable psychological phenomena
of our time&mdash;lies at the bottom of the whole
direct-rule propaganda.</p>

<h2>THE DEMOCRAT REFLECTS</h2>


<p>The Democrat was disillusioned, but he really was a
democrat. He had been cradled and taught in the
atmosphere of democracy, and was possessed by lifelong
conviction of the righteousness of the democratic ideal.
For a long time, too&mdash;until he had come to know more of
the actual business of democracy&mdash;he had never questioned
democratic practice. He was young and innocent.</p>

<p>But the scales had fallen from his eyes; the enlightened
vision of manhood's years had disclosed in democracy a
multitude of undemocratic things of whose existence in his
youthful days he had not even dreamed. The preceptors
of his boyhood had never told him&mdash;or his hopeful heart
had not let him understand&mdash;that men had to struggle
against other men to preserve even that equality to which
they were born; that justice, even in the courts, could be,
in the very nature of things, nothing more than an approximation,
and that, among men of the world in general,
it was often might that made right; that there were ways
of depriving men of the ballot, in spite of enactments;
that laws could be made by the will of minorities, or of
single individuals. Even town-meetings could sometimes
be undemocratic, and his ears were startled by
those who declared that, in the nation's life at large,
there was nothing left of democracy but seeming.</p>

<p>His faith in men had suffered the same rude shocks as
his faith in democracy&mdash;quite naturally, for neither faith
stood alone. He had come to see that the sordidness of
human beings reached heights and depths which his youth,
slow to believe and slower to perceive, had never imagined.
Surely, the love of money <i>was</i> the root of all evil&mdash;or
of nearly all. The heated oratory of the campaign was
mostly inspired by love of money or place. The patriotic
sentiment that so abounded in the press was mostly gush,
the news was colored, and the whole belonged to men with
axes to grind. Yes, the press, that boasted educator of the
people, of whose wondrous achievement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
potentiality&mdash;yes, and whose freedom&mdash;he and his schoolfellows
had written and declaimed, was sometimes bought.
Votes at the polls and in legislative halls were sometimes
bought. Contracts with the government were sometimes
bought. Expert scientific opinion was sometimes bought.
War scares were manufactured for a purpose. Great industries
could use intimidation to secure a party the votes of
their employees. There was no form of meanness in
life high or low that could not find ready a hand for its
undertaking. Cities were sinks of rottenness and suffering
because it paid their democratic administrators to have
them so. The greed of men could force other men to
live and beget their children in unhealthful, degrading
environment, birth into which was birth into slavery
and disease of body and soul. "Life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness" was a mockery to tens of thousands.</p>

<p>And all this took place under a democracy&mdash;a government
which he had been taught was the most equitable on
earth, the refuge of the poor and the oppressed, who sailed
into the haven where Liberty was Enlightening the World
to enter the Land of Promise where all their tears should be
wiped away! And the worst of it was, that those who
talked most loudly of the democratic ideal were those
most eager to profit at its expense. If he could have laid it
all to the rich or the aristocratic, it would not have been
so bad; but he couldn't. The poor were by nature as
greedy and unjust as the rich, and showed themselves as
bad in practice when they had the chance, and the democrat
turned tyrant as soon as it suited his purse or ambition.
It was dismaying. The contrast between the actual
workings of democracy and the ideal his innocence had
worshipped was so enormous that he sometimes doubted
whether they had anything at all in common.</p>

<p>But in time dismay, and even surprise, had worn
away, and he recovered equanimity. He was disillusioned,
but still a democrat. At the same time he learned of
the weakness of his idol, he learned of the weakness
of human nature. He knew that the evils he lamented
were due much more to human weakness than to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
form of government under which the evils occurred.
With a philosopher of his own land, he agreed that no form
of government was so good as not to work ill in the hands
of the bad, and none so bad as not to work well in the
hands of the good. Henceforth, if he must worry, let it
be about men.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the Democrat, from being a partisan,
became a Spectator. Democracy&mdash;or what was called
that&mdash;was amusing: it was so human&mdash;so human in its
faults, so human in its self-deception. He was moved to
smiles at the spectacle of a nation of individuals all wisely
thinking themselves intelligent voters, patriots, and capable
managers of their country's affairs.</p>

<p>Was it, after all, a democracy? The Democrat possessed
the none too common art of looking behind mere
words, and contemplating Things as They Are. He was
reading his magazine one evening&mdash;it contained one
of those comforting political science essays, entitled
"Whither Are We Drifting?"&mdash;when the notion seized on
him to find some better name for the government under
which he lived. So he laid aside the essay, and let his
thoughts run.</p>

<p>Elimination seemed to appeal as a method. He made a
whimsical beginning: it wasn't a timocracy; however much
the love of honor flourished, it seemed agreed that it was
not that which ruled the nation. That the government
wasn't an ochlocracy he also felt sure; for, in spite of the
rule of mobs, in labor troubles, lynchings, institutions of
learning, and weddings in high life, he well knew that the
real authority of the land lay in fewer hands.</p>

<p>Was it, then, an aristocracy? That could not be, for no
one was better than anyone else. In matters of personal
worth there was no superlative; there was not even a comparative.
At least, there was no surer path to defeat at
the polls than for a candidate to be called "better," to
say nothing of "best."</p>

<p>Whether it was a theocracy hardly needed consideration.
True, the coin of the realm recorded the nation's Trust in
God, and God was frequently quoted as being heartily in
favor of a variety of political projects; but on the whole the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Democrat was convinced that the function of the inscription
was decorative, and felt that any proposal to entrust
God alone with the affairs of the nation would create a
mighty upheaval in politics and commerce, and be followed
by a period of depression. He couldn't really see
that God had much part in the actual government, though
he would not go so far as Epicurus, and say that He cared
nothing about what men were doing. He felt more like
agreeing with the Hebrew who conceived God as laughing
men to derision. And besides, to say that the government
was at present a theocracy would place the Democrat in
the position of an adverse critic of the Almighty, which was
as much as to say that he himself was better than the
Almighty; and that would be undemocratic.</p>

<p>On the whole, those who called the government an
oligarchy seemed to be getting more near to reality;
for at certain crises it became quite clear that a few
men determined the measures of government. And
yet, the individuals of the group were not always the same,
but varied according to the interests involved; and they
were not an openly constituted and declared body, elected
by the people. To be sure, they operated through legislators,
but they themselves were more often than not far
removed from open political life. To call the real government
a plutocracy, its governing agents plutocrats, and
their instruments the legislators, seemed reasonable
enough. It was humiliating, it seemed the fact that
the great democracy was ruled, not by itself, but by a
Thing.</p>

<p>However, the rule of money, that is, financial self-interest,
was not really a form of government; it was only
an influence, and one that might work good as well as ill.
It underlay, more or less, all governments, not only modern,
but ancient as well, and had to, in the nature of
things, so long as property existed and prosperity meant
increase. What else did the phenomenon of economic
history-writing signify but the appreciation of this fact?</p>

<p>The Democrat concluded to let the government under
which he lived stand as a democracy. The term might not
be absolutely sufficient, but it covered the case as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
any. At any rate, whatever the reality, the government
was cast in the democratic mold: every man had a vote,
and was sovereign over it, and could sell it, or throw it
away, or even make use of it, as he chose; and he was represented,
or at least thought he was, by someone whom
he elected, or thought he elected; and was heeded when he
clamored his desires or his indignation, provided it didn't
interfere too much with what his representative was induced
to conceive to be the interests of "the people."</p>

<p>And there were also other manifestations of the democratic
ideal which really distinguished the government
under which he lived from that of many other nations.
There was democracy in education. The public set out to
educate <i>all</i> its sons and daughters, from kindergarten to
college Commencement. The day was past when education
was only for gentlemen's sons; the children of the
people, rich and poor, blue-blooded and flat-footed, male
and female, brainy and brainless, came to college, and
within its walls there was no connection, it was said, between
honors and money or place. Students dressed from
the same clothes-shop, yelled the same college yell,
bought their apparatus at a co-operative store, ate at the
same boarding-house, took the same examinations, often
subserving the cause of democracy by evading aristocratic
tyranny in the person of the faculty and making democratic
use of their neighbors' learning, and asked no questions
about each other's finances or forbears&mdash;except, of
course, the fraternity and sorority students, who had <i>tria
nomina</i> and were the exceptions to prove the rule.</p>

<p>And not only were the college rolls and records indicative
of democracy, but there was a democracy of subjects
to study. You had free election: one subject was as good
as another, one course as valuable as another. So long as
you had the required number of credits, the character of
the credits made no difference: an hour contained sixty
minutes, and no hour set up to be better than its fellows.
A college education was defined as "something of everything
for everybody," and the definition was especially
applicable to the education of the State Universities, those
great examples of learning in action. In them anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
might study anything at any time under any instructor
under any conditions and in any place&mdash;for you could
study in absence, and by correspondence, and hypnotism,
and Christian Science. And when you got through, whatever
your method or matter or capacity or docility or
imbecility, you were labelled A. B., and were as good as
any other A. B., and had a fortune assured&mdash;until you
found out that the great democratic world thought A. B.
no better than D. F., or any other combination of letters,
or no letters at all.</p>

<p>Yes, and there was democracy of religion as well as of
education. Ministers wore plain clothes, avoided religion
in conversation, greeted everyone with the loudness which
in some way had become confused with cordiality, romped
with children, attended kissing parties, and used slang in
sermons. Men believed anything, or nothing; it was a free
country, a free age. Any religion, or any interpretation of
it, was as good as any other, so long as you really believed
it. You could pray kneeling, or standing, or sitting, or
walking, or jumping&mdash;as you chose. You could interpret
your creed literally, or symbolically, or allegorically, or
pragmatically. You could devote your church edifice to
God, or you could make it a meeting-house for the people,
and use it for socials, athletics, kindergarten, lyceum,
vaudeville, soup kitchens, rummage sales, teachers' institutes&mdash;and
when all these religious activities grew too
extensive for it, you could sell it to the liveryman or the
storage company or the movie-man. What were churches
for, if not for the people?</p>

<p>There was democracy in art, too&mdash;especially in literature.
Poets wrote in what vein and in what meter they
chose, at what length, with what attention to rhyme and
rhythm, with what preparation or equipment they chose.
They bowed before no laws, ancient or modern. If they
made use of the great names in poetry, it was to justify
their own vagaries. They not only pleaded Tennyson for
Tennysonian liberties, but took what additional license
they chose on the ground of personal liberty. Didn't
Homer nod? Of course; and, taking advantage of the
example, they slept the sleep of the unworrying. Poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could write in prose, and prose authors dress their commonplace
thoughts in verse. In oratory and the novel,
matter was all, form nothing. Men were content if their
readers <i>could</i> get their meaning; the compelling power of
style and accurate expression were qualities for which they
were unwilling to pay the price of long and patient preparation.
Olympus, Helicon, and Arcadia had become the
paradise of anarchists, to say nothing of democrats. Who
cared now when Zeus's ambrosial locks were shaken in
wrath, or Apollo slammed his baton down in a rage?
Who were they, to set up to be better than others?</p>

<p>And, as for painters and sculptors, and architects and
musicians, who should presume to tyrannize over them by
requiring standards of style or subject? If an architect
chose to construct a High School that looked like a prison
or a warehouse, why shouldn't he? After all, what was
the High School but the people's college, and what was its
purpose if not to fit the sons and daughters of the commonwealth
for life, and why <i>should</i> it be built in the Tudor
style, or in any other style? What the people needed was
usefulness, not style. And if a musician wished to compose
an overture imitative of all the noises that accompanied
the Retreat from Moscow, including French and
Russian profanity, or if a painter preferred to paint a
drunken prostitute rather than Diana or a Daughter of
the Revolution, why shouldn't he? It was a free country,
a democratic age, and it was time art entered into the
service of the people.</p>

<p>And there was democracy of manners, too, and of dress.
Democracy had grown so used to insisting on clothes not
making the man, that distinction in dress had long been
a rarity, and men were no longer constrained to live up to
the garb they wore. You could wear a white vest without
obligation to keep it clean, and you could appear with
silk hat and long coat without being suspected of religion
or literature. Men made the clothes now: the process
was reversed; they made them by the wholesale, every
season, and if you weren't satisfied with a good democratic
costume&mdash;i. e., the one imposed by the despotic
democratic fashion of the season&mdash;and had your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
clothing made to adorn, why, you were an aristocrat.</p>

<p>And if clothes didn't oblige, neither did <i>noblesse</i>, that
other aristocratic bugbear, oblige. Gentlemen? Family?
Why, everyone was a gentleman, from pugilist to
preacher. Who said so? Why, who but the gentleman
himself? It was a free country, and a man had a right to
be a gentleman if he chose, didn't he? Just what a gentleman
was, to be sure, no one seemed able to say; but no one
failed to lay claim to the title, or to pull off his coat and
prove the justice of his claim if you denied it. Surely
there was no greater proof of the beneficent power of
democracy than that it made all men gentlemen, and all
women ladies.</p>

<p>And there was democracy in the home as well. The
American husband was so democratic that he bettered the
apostolic instruction which told wives to be obedient to
their husbands. You might have thought that it read the
reverse. And children&mdash;the children of democratic
America were famous the world over for their unquestioning
assumption of knowledge and authority, for their
assurance and aggressiveness; for their easy contradiction
of their parents, who were intimidated by the pedagogical
direction never to let your child fear you. Travellers returned
from Europe and reported no Hans and Giovannino
who made wide the mouth and thrust out the tongue
in the streets of aristocracy. Since the time of the bald-headed
prophet and the two and forty she-bears, it had
been natural for youth to presume on its superiority, but
it was only the spirit of democracy which seemed to <i>encourage</i>
the presumption.</p>

<p>But why not? If democracy meant equality, why not
be consistent? If all men&mdash;black and white, good and
bad, rich and poor, wise and foolish&mdash;were to be made
equal, why not all women with them? Women were surely
members of the commonwealth. And why not all children?
Hadn't Spencer said so? Children were members
of the commonwealth, too. And why not the beasts, wild
and tame, who were also part and parcel of the population
of the country? Why stop merely with men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the Democrat concluded, his country was best described
as a democracy, even though the few ruled over
the many in matters of substance, and the many ruled over
the few in art and manners, and both were tyrants. He
remembered Plato's definition&mdash;Plato the blasphemer&mdash;and
it seemed applicable to his own time: "Democracy, a
charming form of government, full of variety and diversity,
and dispensing equality to equals and unequals alike."
It was marvellous how men believed in their equality with
other men, what self-confidence they possessed, and what
assurance came to them from the oft repeated word liberty.
"This is a free country, and I'm just as good as you"
could be said by anyone, and was said by everyone, and
as a result his back was a little stiffer and his head a degree
or two more erect. Foreigners learned to say it before
they learned to speak the language. The very animals
seemed to understand it; it was Plato over again: "And
the horses and asses had come to have a way of marching
along with all the rights and dignities of free men; and
they would run at anybody whom they met in the street
if he did not get out of their way: and all things were just
ready to burst with liberty."</p>

<p>The Democrat, you see, through his habit of looking at
Things as They Are, had come to possess a lively sense of
the ridiculous side of democracy&mdash;its inconsistencies, its
unconscious enjoyment of words, its silly self-deception
and placid self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen the workings of his mind, you
will easily understand, too, how the expression of his
thoughts might provoke those who were always on the
lookout for the red rag of aristocracy. And the fact is,
that on occasion he did express his thoughts with great
frankness and no little vehemence; and, as no one likes
to be told his faults by even a friendly critic, he often
brought the angry hornets of democracy about his ears.</p>

<p>Yes, and by your smiling you seem to say that he deserved
it. And yet I assure you now, as I did in the beginning,
that he was really a democrat. You must not mistake
realization of the faults of democracy in operation for
hostility to democracy itself. He had seen something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
life in aristocratic countries, and was thankful above all
things that there <i>was</i> something in the atmosphere of his
own land which had the effect of making men look up. This
virtue alone covered a multitude of the sins of democracy.
There <i>was</i> something in his country more than the mere
form of democratic society. Whether men got their rights
or not, they knew they had rights, and anyone who wanted
to make them consent to injustice had at least to take the
trouble of giving it the appearance of justice. And not
only were they possessed of a lively sense of their own
rights, but the air was full of talk about other people's having
<i>their</i> rights. Generosity and benevolence were abroad
in the land. It was, to be sure, something of the sort of
Sidney Smith's benevolence&mdash;the feeling which A experienced
when he thought B ought to do something to relieve
C's necessities; but even that kind was better than none.
It was vastly important whether large classes of human
beings acquiesced in being regarded as cattle&mdash;as they
seemed to in the Old World&mdash;or not.</p>

<p>But if he had a vivid sense of the desirability of the democratic
ideal, he had just as vivid a sense of the dangers of
democratic practice. It was not difficult to see that the
universal talk about making all men equal, vapid as it
might be, was having an effect which could but make the
judicious grieve. It was pulling excellence from her lofty
seat to set her on a level with mediocrity. Democracy
aimed at equality. But equality on a high plane was impossible.
Certain men&mdash;most men&mdash;could not rise to a
high plane, or would not. Those therefore who could
climb were not to keep on climbing, but to remain at the
lower level, or return from the heights, or assist those who
were at the lowest of all. Not all could reach the mountain
top; therefore let those who <i>were</i> able to make the
ascent engage in assisting the great majority to attain the
<i>middle</i> space of the incline. Not all could take a college
degree; therefore let the college degree be brought within
the reach of all. Not all could be gentlemen; therefore
reconstruct and democratize the definition of the gentleman.
In scholarship, religion, manners, in literature, in
all the arts&mdash;in everything except the art of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
money&mdash;democracy seemed in danger of fostering the
mediocre, and discouraging the excellent. In its effort for
breadth, it was encouraging shallowness. It might be that
for the poorest, the meanest, and the stupidest, democracy
meant individualism and opportunity; but for the brightest
and most ambitious, it seemed to partake of the nature
of tyranny. The main idea in Plato's Republic was the
sacrifice of the individual to the whole. In the Modern
Republic it seemed something like the sacrifice of the best
to the good, the leveling down of the highest as well as the
raising up of the lowest. Certain kinds of talent and effort
were in great danger of neglect&mdash;the kind of talent and
effort which had made nations live in history. If there was
anything in the record of the past, if civilization was not
on the wrong track, and if literature and religion and the
arts were indeed the supremely worth while, it seemed
plain that the encouragement of uniformity beyond limits
was a crime against the race. The atoms of Democritus,
streaming forever downward in parallel lines, would never
have accomplished a world. It needed an Epicurus and a
Lucretius to recognize that they must have swerved from
their deadly course of uniformity. It took friction and collision
to beget a universe. The democratic passion for
freedom and equality and uniformity once fully realized,
what deadness and monotony! And as for the boasted
educating power of responsibility, there was as little
chance for it in the frictionless machine of perfect democracy
as under despotism itself.</p>

<p>Democracy certainly did savor of the machine; just as
the object of machinery was to insure a uniform product
without personal handling of each individual piece, so the
object of democracy seemed to be in such wise to regulate
the affairs of men that justice would be automatic.</p>

<p>The fact was, human laziness occupied great space in the
foundations of the democratic spirit. There were other
qualities also, of course. There was misapprehension.
The democratic poor imagined ideal possession on the part
of those more prosperous than themselves, and the democratic
rich imagined the extreme of unpossession on the
part of those poorer than themselves; and both forgot, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had never discovered, what Horace knew two thousand
years ago, that the poor man was seasick in the hired skiff
the same as the rich man in his private trireme. And
there was the spirit of restlessness&mdash;the everlasting desire
of the human animal for new things, and his perennial
ignorance of the fact that a change of sky did not necessarily
mean a change of heart. And of course there was
human sympathy, the greatest of them all.</p>

<p>But the place of human laziness was great. Men shrank
from responsibility; uniformity and automatic justice appealed
to them. Democracy was a labor-saving device.
The meting out of justice by and to individuals was difficult,
and took time, and, what was worse, thought. It was
much easier to legislate a form of equality, and have done
with it&mdash;to press a button, have a uniform product, and
not bother with hand-made goods.</p>

<p>Not that equality and uniformity were undesirable. The
trouble with the popular democratic ideal consisted only
in its exaggeration. The democracy of the enthusiastic
multitude was an extreme. Aristocracy went to the extreme
of inequality and diversity, and democracy went to
the extreme of equality and uniformity. Both extremes
were vicious; for vices are only exaggerated virtues. And
vices are easier than virtue, extremes easier than the golden
mean. To proceed on the assumption that all men
could be treated as free and equal was easier by far than to
recognize and study their inequalities and limitations, and
to attempt the best for each individual; but the result was
only a vicious approximation.</p>

<p>Let democracy recognize that there were two sides to
the shield. The Democrat sympathized with the ignorant
and needy, and believed that the more fortunate should
make cheerful sacrifice to help them rise. As for himself,
he would regulate his conduct among men on the basis of
worth, not wealth or blood,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>scilicet uni æquus virtuti atque eius amicis</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and stand ready to obey unselfishly any measure for the
common good, however undesirable from his particular
point of view. If, however, he demanded sacrifice on the
part of the more fortunate in the interest of the masses, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
demanded no less the spirit of sacrifice on the part of the
masses for the sake of such of their fellows as gave evidence
of superior worth. A democracy should be a great
family, in which the sons of promise were gladly helped on
their way to honor and usefulness, even at the cost of deprivation
and suffering on the part of the rest of the household&mdash;as
in many an actual family which performed such
sacrifice, and rejoiced in it&mdash;and by the sacrifice added
to its own glory and strength. It should give all its sons
and daughters the greatest possible opportunity of self-realization,
but never fail to recognize that some selves
were more worth realization than others. Whatever was
levelled, let it not be intellect or character.</p>

<p>After all, government was a means, not an end. The
end was character&mdash;individual <i>and</i> national. A form of
government was good or bad as it succeeded or failed to
produce that depth and breadth of individual and collective
spirit which marked great eras in history&mdash;such a
spirit as that which made possible the Parthenon or the
North Portal of the Erechtheum; or turned back the
Armada; or inspired the Italian Risorgimento; or crystallized
into the dramas of Shakespeare or Sophocles; or
formed the soul of other periods when men were actuated
by passionate desire for the common good and common
glory, for time <i>and</i> eternity. The momentary good of the
individual&mdash;his comfort or enjoyment&mdash;was a worthy
ideal only in so far as it contributed to character. Without
elevation of the ideals of the individual citizen, there could
be no great leaders; without great leaders there was no
vision, and the people perished.</p>

<p>So it appears that the Democrat's ideal society was
somewhere between that of Plato, who thought that,
until the union of political power and philosophy in the
same person could be effected, there would be no relief,
and that in which the Democrat lived, where men were
chosen lawmakers and rulers ostensibly because they were
good fellows, or at least none of your damned aristocrats.</p>

<h2>THE NEW MORALITY</h2>


<p>Some ten or twelve years ago a certain young
woman, then fresh from the hands of an esteemed
but erratic professor of English literature, wrote a novel
the plot of which was roughly as follows. A college graduate
suddenly finds himself the inheritor of a shoe factory
in a New England town. Filled with the benevolent ideas
absorbed in the academic contemplation of economics, he
undertakes to introduce profit-sharing with his employees
and otherwise to conduct his business for the benefit of
the community. So far, good. But hard times follow,
and his competitors by lowering wages and reducing labor
are able to undersell him. Now there is in his control a
considerable sum of money which a widow had entrusted
to his father to invest for her, and the question arises
whether he shall shut down his mills and inflict suffering
upon his men, or shall divert this trust fund to his business
and so try to tide over the period of stress. He yields to
his sympathies and virtually embezzles the trust fund;
but fails nevertheless, and with his own loss brings ruin
upon the widow. The story was called "The Burden of
Christopher," with the implication that the hero was a
bearer of Christ in his misfortune, and the author indicates
pretty clearly her sentiment that in surrendering
his personal integrity for the expected good of his working
people he was following the higher of two conflicting codes
of ethics.</p>

<p>The book no doubt has gone its own way to the "limbo
large and broad," where the heroes of ancient fiction wander
with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Embryoes and idiots, eremits and friars;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but it made a lasting impression on one reader at least,
as the first popular presentation to come under his notice
of a theory which now confronts him wherever he turns his
eyes. There has, in fact, been an astonishing divulgation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in the past decade of what is called, with magnificent
audacity, the New Morality.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most honored teacher of this code is the
mistress of Hull House, who by her devoted life and her
services to the people of Chicago in various times of need
has won the right to speak with a certain authority for the
striving generation of the day. And in one of her books,
the "Newer Ideals of Peace," Miss Addams tells of an
actual occurrence and infers a moral which points in the
same direction as the novel of "Christopher." A family of
five children is left motherless. The father, a drunkard,
disappears, and the household is left to the care of a feeble
old grandmother. Thereupon work is found for the oldest
boy, "a fine, manly little fellow" of twelve, who feels
keenly "his obligation to care for the family"; but after
a time he becomes "listless and indifferent," and at sixteen
turns to professional tramping. "It was through such
bitter lessons as these," observes Miss Addams, "we
learned that good intentions and the charitable impulse
do not always work for righteousness." As the story is
told there is a plain implication that to find work for a
boy under such circumstances is "cruel and disastrous"
(her own comment), and that society, and not his own
nature, was responsible for his relapse. One would suppose
that scarcely an honest workman, or prosperous merchant,
or successful professional man had ever taken up the burden
of life in youth or childhood. Certainly, hardship
and physical waste often result from the demands of life,
but there is not a single word in Miss Addams's account to
indicate that she has felt the higher need for the future
citizen of developing in him a sensitiveness to the peculiar
duties that confront him, or has reflected on the moral evil
that might have been done the boy if he had been relieved
of his natural obligations and his family had been supported
by society. "Our democracy," as she says with
approval, "is making inroads upon the family, the oldest
of human institutions."</p>

<p>This is not an isolated case in Miss Addams's works,
nor does it in any wise misrepresent her. In another book,
"The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets," the thesis is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
maintained and reiterated, that crime is for the most part
merely the result of repressing a wholesome "love for excitement"
and "desire for adventure." In the year 1909
"there were arrested and brought into court [in Chicago]
fifteen thousand young people under the age of twenty,
who had failed to keep even the common law of the land.
Most of these young people had broken the law in their
blundering efforts to find adventure." The inference to
be drawn here and throughout the book is that one need
only relieve the youth of the land from the necessity of
"assuming responsibility prematurely," affording them
meanwhile abundant amusement, and the instincts of
lawlessness and the pursuit of criminal pleasure will vanish,
or almost vanish, of themselves&mdash;as if there were no
Harry Thaws, and the sons of the rich were all virtuous.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that Hull House occupies
a place of lonely isolation as the fountain of these ideas.
From every self-authorized centre of civic virtue in which
a type-writer is at work, the stream proceeds. The very
presses groan, as we used to say when those machines were
still in the mythological stage, at their labor of supplying
the world with the new intellectual pabulum. At this
moment there lies before the writer of this article a pile of
books, all recently published, which are devoted more or
less specifically to the subject, and from all of which, if he
had courage to go through them, he might cull abundant
examples and quotations. He was, indeed, about to enter
this "hollow cave, amid the thickest woods," when, an
unvaliant knight, he heard the warning of the lady Una:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I better wot then you, though now too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have in fact to deal with the consummation of a
long and deep-seated revolution, and there is no better
way to understand the true character of the movement
than by turning aside a moment to glance at its historical
sources. The attempt to find a new basis of conduct, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
see it exemplified in the works of Miss Jane Addams and a
host of other modern writers, is in fact only one aspect of
the slow drift from mediæval religion to humanitarianism.
For a thousand years, and well into the second thousand,
the ethical feeling of Christian Europe may be said to
have taken its color from the saying, "What shall it profit
a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?"&mdash;which in extreme cases was interpreted as if it
read, If he <i>reform</i> the whole world; and on the other,
kindred saying, "Sell all that thou hast and distribute unto
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and
come, follow me"&mdash;in which the command of charity was
held to be not so much for the benefit of the poor as for
the liberation of the giver's own soul from the powers of
this world. Such was the law, and its binding force was
confirmed by the conception of a final day of wrath when
the souls of men should stand before a merciless tribunal
and be judged to everlasting joy or everlasting torment.
The vivid reality of the fear that haunted men, at least
in their moments of reflection, may be understood from
the vivid horrors of such a picture as Michael Angelo's
"Last Judgment," or from the meditations of one of
the most genial of English cavaliers. In his little treatise
on "Man in Darkness"&mdash;appropriate title&mdash;Henry
Vaughan puts the frank question to himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And what madness then is it, for the enjoying of one minute's
pleasure for the satisfaction of our sensual corrupt appetite, to lie
forever in a bed of burning brass, in the lake of eternal and unquenchable
fire? "Suppose," saith the same writer [Drexelius],
"that this whole globe of earth were nothing else but a huge
mass or mountain of sand, and that a little wren came but once
in every thousand years to fetch away but one grain of that huge
heap; what an innumerable number of years would be spent before
that world of sand could be so fetched away! And yet, alas!
when the damned have lain in that fiery lake so many years as
all those would amount to, they are no nearer coming out than
the first hour they entered in."</p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt practice and precept were at variance then,
as to a certain extent they are at all times, and there were
many texts in the Bible which might be taken to mitigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the harsher commands; but such in its purest, highest
form was the law, and in the more sensitive minds this
conception of the soul naked before a judging God must
have created a tremendous anxiety in practice. Morality
was obedience and integrity and scorn of the world for an
ideal of inner righteousness; it created a sense of individual
responsibility for every word and deed; and, say what we
will, there was something magnificent in this contempt of
the reckoning of other men for that eternal fame which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... lives and speaks aloft by those pure eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perfect witness of all-judging Jove.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there was also in this law something repellent and
even monstrous. Who has not shuddered with amazement
at the inscription which Dante set over the portal of Hell:
E 'L PRIMO AMORE? Was it Love that prepared those
winding coils of torture to enclose for endless time the
vast majority of mankind? Was it even justice to make
the everlasting doom of a soul depend on its grasp of truth
in these few years spent in a world of shadows and illusions?
There is something repulsively irrational in the
notion of an unchanging eternity suspended on the action
of a moment of time&mdash;<i>ex hoc momento pendet æternitas</i>.
It should seem to be unthinkable, if it had not actually
been thought. As a matter of fact the rigor and crudity of
this doctrine had been mitigated in the Middle Ages by the
interposition between man and God of the very human
institution of the Church with its substitution of temporal
penances and pardons, and an interposed Purgatory
in place of the terrible paradox of irrevocable judgment.
It remained for the Reformation and particularly
for the Calvinistic Puritans to tear away those veils
of compromise and bring man face to face with the awful
abstraction he had created. The result was for a while a
great hardening and strengthening of character, salutary
indeed after what may be called the almost hypocritical
compromise of Catholicism; but in the end human nature
could not endure the rigidity of its own logic, and in revolting
turned, not to another compromise, but to questioning
of the very hypothesis of its faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The inevitable reaction from the intolerable logic of the
Protestants was Deism, in which God was stript altogether
of his judicial and moral attributes and reduced to a kind
of immanent, all-benevolent force in nature. "But now
comes a modern Sage," says Warburton of Bolingbroke,
"... who tells us 'that they made the Basis of
Religion far too wide; that men have no further concern
with <span class="smcap">God</span> than <span class="smcap lowercase">TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS</span>, which his <i>physical
Attributes</i> make fully manifest; but, that he is <i>a rewarder of
them who diligently seek him</i>, Religion doth not require us
to believe, since this depends on God's <span class="smcap lowercase">MORAL ATTRIBUTES</span>,
of which we have no conception.'" But such a position
was manifestly untenable, for it left no place for the undeniable
existence of evil in this world and life. From the unaccountable
distribution of wrong and suffering the divine
had argued the certainty of adjustment in a future state;
the deist had flown in the face of facts by retaining the
belief in a benevolent Providence while taking from it the
power of supernatural retribution; the atheist was more
logical, he denied the existence of Providence altogether
and turned the universe over to chance or blind law. Such
was the progress of thought from Baxter to Bolingbroke
and from Bolingbroke to Hume.</p>

<p>The positive consequences of this evolution are written
large in the literature of the eighteenth century. With the
idea of an avenging deity and a supernatural test there
disappeared also the sense of deep personal responsibility;
the very notion of a radical and fundamental difference
between good and evil was lost. The evil that is apparent
in character comes to be regarded merely as the result of
the restraining and thwarting institutions of society as
these exist&mdash;why, no one could explain. Envy and jealousy
and greed and the sheer ambition of power, all those
traits, which were summed up in the single Greek word
<i>pleonexia</i>, <i>the desire to have more</i>, are not inherent in the
human heart, but are artificially introduced by the possession
of property and a false civilization. Change these
institutions or release the individual entirely from restrictions,
and his nature will recoil spontaneously to its
natural state of virtue. He needs only follow the impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of his instinctive emotions to be sound and good. And as
a man feels of himself, so he feels of others. There is no
real distinction between the good and the evil, but all are
naturally good, and the superficial variations we see are
caused by the greater or less freedom of development.
Hence we should condemn no man, even as we do not
condemn ourselves. There is no place for sharp judgment,
and the laws which impose penalties and restrictions, and
set up false discriminations between the innocent and the
criminal, are subject to suspicion, and should be made as
flexible as possible. In place of judgment we are to regard
all mankind with sympathy, feeling with them a sort of
emotional solidarity, the one great virtue, in which are
included, or rather sunk, all the law and the prophets.
In fine, we have arrived at humanitarianism; humanity
has become God.</p>

<p>It was the great work of the eighteenth century, beginning
in England and developing in France, to formulate
this change, and indoctrinate with it the mind of the unthinking
masses. Here is not the place to follow the development
in detail, and those who care to see its outcome
may be referred to the keen and unjustly neglected chapters
in La Harpe's "Lycée" on the <i>philosophes</i>. To those,
indeed, who are acquainted with the philosophical writings
that preceded and introduced the French Revolution, the
epithet "new" as it is attached to our present-day morality
may seem a bit presumptuous, for it would be difficult
to find a single fundamental idea in current literature on
this subject which could not be closely paralleled by a
quotation from Rousseau, or Diderot, or Helvétius, or one
of their compeers. Thus, in our exaltation of sympathy
above judgment, and of the unrestrained emotions generally
as the final rule of character, we are but following
Diderot's philosophy of the heart: "Les passions amorties
dégradent les hommes extraordinaires"; and when we read
in Ellen Key, and a host of other feminist liberators, the
apotheosis of love as higher than any divine or human obligations,
we are but meeting again with Toussaint's religion
a little disguised: "On aime de même Dieu et sa
maîtresse." Our revolt from constitutional law as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
power imposed by the slower reflection of men upon their
own immediate desires and opinions, is essentially the
same as the restlessness consecrated by the French <i>économistes</i>
in the phrase, "le despotisme légal." And, to return
whence we began, the economics of Hull House flow
only too easily from Helvétius' definition of virtue as "le
désir du bien public," and from his more specific statement:
"The integrity which is related to an individual or
to a small society is not the true integrity; integrity considered
in relation to the public is the only kind that really
deserves and generally obtains the name."</p>

<p>Miss Addams herself has been disturbed by these
reminiscences. Thus she quotes from one of the older
humanitarians a characteristic saying: "The love of those
whom a man does not know is quite as elemental a sentiment
as the love of those whom a man does know," and
repudiates it as vague and impractical beside the New
Morality. She ought to know, and may be right; yet it
is not easy to see wherein her own ethics are any less vague,
when she deplores the act of a boy who goes to work for
his starving grandmother because in doing so he is unfitting
himself for future service to society. And as for
effectiveness, it might seem that the French Revolution
was a practical result fairly equivalent in magnitude to
what has been achieved by our college settlements. But
Miss Addams is by no means peculiar in this assumption of
originality. Nothing is more notable in the Humanitarian
literature of the day than the feeling that our own age is
severed from the past, and opens an entirely new epoch in
history. "<i>The race has now crossed the great divide of
human history!</i>" exclaims an hysterical doctor of divinity
in a book just published. "The tendency of the long past
has been toward <i>diversity</i>, that of the longer future will be
toward <i>oneness</i>. The change in this stream of tendency is
not a temporary deviation from its age-long course&mdash;a
new bend in the river. It is an actual reversal of the
current, which beyond a peradventure will prove permanent."
To this ecstatic watcher, the sudden reversal took
place at no remote date, but yesterday; and by a thousand
other watchers the same miracle is vociferously heralded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Beyond a peradventure! Not a little of this flattering
assumption is due to the blind and passionate hope of the
human heart clamoring against the voice of experience
from similar and different movements in the past, which
have somehow failed to renovate the world. So many
prophets before now have cried out, looking at the ever-flowing
current of time, and having faith in some Thessalian
magic:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cessavere vices rerum.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">... Amnisque cucurrit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non qua pronus erat.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So often they have been disappointed; but at last we have
seen&mdash;beyond a peradventure. If the vicissitudes of
fate have not ceased, yet at least we have learned to look
with complacency on the very law of mutation, from which
the eyes of men had hitherto turned away in bewildered
horror, at last the stream has turned back upon its sources,
and change itself is carrying us no longer towards diversity,
but towards the consummation of a divine oneness.</p>

<p>But it would equally be an error to insist too dogmatically
on the continuity of the present-day movement with
that of the eighteenth century, for, after all, "the world
do move." It is true for one thing that for a hundred
years or thereabout there was a partial reaction against
the doctrines of the <i>philosophes</i>, during which time the
terrors of the Revolution lay like a warning nightmare in
the imagination of the more thoughtful men. A hundred
years is a long period for the memory to bridge, particularly
in a time when the historical sense has been weakened.
Superficially, too, the application of the theory is
in some respects different from what it was; the law of
social sympathy has been developed into different conceptions
of Socialism, and we have devised fresh schemes
for giving efficacy to the immediate will of the people.
Even deeper is the change that has come over the attitude
of religious organizations towards the movement. In the
age of the Revolution the Church, both Catholic and
Protestant, was still strongly entrenched in the old beliefs,
and offered a violent resistance to the substitutions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
humanitarianism for responsibility to itself and to a God.
Now this last barrier has been almost swept away. Indeed,
not the least remarkable feature of this literature is the
number of clergymen who are contributing to it, with
their constant appeal to the New Morality as the test of
faith. Open one of these books before us&mdash;let us take
"The Christian Reconstruction of Modern Life," for the
promise of its title&mdash;and you will be pretty likely to
come upon such a passage as this: "Faith's fellowship
with Jesus is one with the realization of our fellowship in
humanity"; or, on another page: "If the fundamental of
the true philosophy cannot be found by common men, what
advantage in any man's finding it? If life's secret, direction,
and power ... is not attainable by the lowliest,
then a man of this age, living in the social passion of our
time, is forced to be indifferent to that which would be the
monopoly of a few gifted souls." If such a social passion
means anything, it means the reconstruction of life to the
level of the gutter. It is the modern sham righteousness
which would have called from Jesus the same utter scorn
as that which he poured upon the Pharisaical cant of his
own day. Yet it is not in religious books alone that you
will meet with this sort of irreligion. For one sermon you
will hear on the obligation of the individual soul to its
maker and judge, and on the need of regeneration and the
beauty of holiness, you will hear a score on the relation of
a man to his fellows and on the virtue of social sympathy.
In effect, the first and great commandment, "Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
soul and with all thy mind," has been almost forgotten
for the second, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
Worship in the temple is no longer a call to contrition and
repentance, but an organized flattery of our human nature,
and the theological seminary is fast becoming a special
school for investigating poverty and spreading agnosticism.
In this sense, or degree, that humanitarianism
is no longer opposed by organized religion, but has itself
usurped the place of religion, the New Morality may
really justify its name.</p>

<p>What are the results of this glorification of humanity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
What does the New Morality mean in life and conduct?
Well, of such matters it is wise to speak cautiously. The
actual morals of an age are an extremely complicated and
elusive network of facts, and it is only too easy to generalize
from incomplete observation. On the other hand we
must guard against allowing ourselves to be deceived by
the fallacy everywhere heard, that, because the preacher
has always, even from the remotest record of Egypt, bewailed
his own times as degenerate, therefore no age has
fallen off in morality from its predecessor. Such an argument
is a complete <i>non-sequitur</i>; there have been periods
of degeneration, and there may yet be. As for our own
age, only a fool would dogmatize; we can only balance
and surmise. And in the first place a certain good must
almost certainly be placed to the credit of humanitarianism.
It has softened us and made us quicker to respond
to the sufferings of others; the direct and frightful cruelty
that runs through the annals of history like a crimson
line has been largely eliminated from civilization, and
with it a good deal of the brutality of human nature. We
sometimes hear the present age compared with the later
Roman Republic and the Empire, and in some respects
speciously, but the callousness of the great Romans to
human misery and their hardness are almost unthinkable
to-day. Consider a sentence or two from Appian: "The
head and hand of Cicero were suspended for a long time
from the rostra in the forum where formerly he had been
accustomed to make public speeches, and more people
came together to behold this spectacle than had previously
come to listen to him. It is said that even at his meals
Antony placed the head of Cicero before his table, until
he became satiated with the horrid sight." Such an
episode scarcely stands out from the hideous story of the
Civil Wars; to the modern reader it brings a feeling almost
of physical sickness. So much we seem to have gained,
and the change in this respect even from our own seventeenth
century shows that the credit is due in no small part
to the general trend of humanitarianism.</p>

<p>But in other directions the progress is not so clear.
Statistics are always treacherous witnesses, but so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
we can believe them and interpret them we can at best
draw no comfort from the prevalence of crime and prostitution
and divorce and insanity and suicide. At least,
whatever may be the cause of this inner canker of society,
our social passion seems to be powerless to cure it. Some
might even argue that the preaching of any doctrine
which minimizes personal responsibility is likely to increase
the evil. Certainly a teacher who, like Miss Jane
Addams, virtually attributes the lawless and criminal
acts of our city hoodlums to the wholesome desire of
adventure which the laws unrighteously repress, would
appear to be encouraging the destructive and sensual
proclivities which are too common in human nature,
young and old. Nor are the ways of honesty made clear
by a well-known humanitarian judge of Denver, who refused
to punish a boy for stealing a Sunday-School
teacher's pocketbook, for the two good reasons, as his
honor explained in a public address, "that the boy was
not responsible, and, secondly, that there were bigger
thieves in the pews upstairs." So, too, a respectable
woman of New York who asks whether it may not be
a greater wrong for a girl to submit to the slavery of low
wages than to sell herself on the street, is manifestly not
helping the tempted to resist. She is even doing what she
can with her words to confuse the very bounds of moral
and physical evil.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, a terrible confusion hidden in the New
Morality, an ulcerous evil that is ever working inward.
Sympathy, creating the desire for even-handed justice,
is in itself an excellent motive of conduct, and the stronger
it grows, the better the world shall be. But sympathy,
spoken with the word "social" prefixed, as it commonly is
on the platforms of the day, begins to take on a dangerous
connotation. And "social sympathy" erected into a
theory which leaves out of account the responsibility of
the individual, and seeks to throw the blame of evil on the
laws and on society, though it may effect desirable reforms
here and there in institutions, is bound to leave the
individual weakened in his powers of resistance against
the temptations which can never be eliminated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
human life. The whole effect of calling sympathy justice,
and putting it in the place of judgment, is to relax the
fibre of character, and nourish the passions at the expense
of reason and the will. And undoubtedly the conviction
is every day gaining ground among cool observers of our
life that the manners and morals of the people are beginning
to suffer from this relaxation in many insidious ways
apart from acts which come into the cognizance of the
courts. The sensuality of the prevailing music and dancing,
the plays that stir the country as organs of moral
regeneration, the exaggeration of sex in the clothing seen
on the street, are but symptoms more or less ominous to
our mind as we do or do not connect them with the regnant
theory of ethics. And in the end this form of social
sympathy may itself quite conceivably bring back the
brutality and cruelty from which it seems to have delivered
us. The Roman who gloated over the head of his
and the people's enemy lived two thousand years ago, and
we think such bloodthirstiness is no longer possible in
public life. Yet not much more than a century ago the
preaching of social sympathy could send a Lebon and his
kind over France with an insatiable lust for killing, complicated
with Sadism, while at home the leader of the
Government of the most civilized country of Europe was
justifying such a régime on the pious principle that, "when
the sovereign people exercises its power, we can only bow
before it; in all it does all is virtue and truth, and no excess,
error, or crime is possible." The animal is not dead
within us, but only asleep. If you think he has been really
conquered, read what he has been doing in Congo and the
Putomayo Indians, or among the redeemers of the Balkan
states. Or if you wish to get a glimpse of what he may yet
do under the spur of social sympathy, consider the callous
indifference shown by the labor unions to the revelation,
if it deserves the name, of the system of dynamiting and
murder employed in the service of "class-consciousness."
These things are to be taken into account, not as bugbears,
for society at large is no doubt sound at heart and will
arouse itself at last against its false teachers, but as
symptoms to warn and prepare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>To some few the only way out of what seems a state of
moral blindness is through a return to an acknowledgment
of the responsibility of the individual soul to its
maker and inflexible judge. They may be right. Who
can tell what reversal of belief may lie before us or what
religious revolution may be preparing in the heart of infidelity?
But for the present, at least, that supernatural
control has lost its general efficacy, and even from the
pulpit has only a slight and intermittent appeal. Nor
does such a loss appear without its compensations, when
we consider the harshness of mediæval theology or the
obliquities of superstition that seem to be inherent in
the purest of religions. Meanwhile, the troubled individual,
whatever his scepticism may be, need not be withheld
from confirming his moral faith by turning from the perverted
doctrine of the "Enlightenment" and its recrudescence
in modern humanitarianism, to the larger and
higher philosophy which existed long before the materialism
of the eighteenth century, and before the earlier
anthropomorphism, and which persisted unchanged,
though often half-concealed, through those ages, and still
persists as a kind of shamefast inheritance of truth. It
is not necessary to go to ancient books to recover that
faith. Let a man cease for a moment to look so strenuously
upon what is right for his neighbors. Let him shut
out the voices of the world, and disregard the stream of
informing books which pour upon him from the modern
press, as the "floud of poyson" was spewed upon Spenser's
Knight from "<i>Errours den</i>":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her fruitful cursed spawne of serpents small.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let him retire into himself, and in the silence of such
recollection examine his own motives and the sources of
his self-approval and discontent. He will discover there
in that dialogue with himself, if his abstraction is complete
and sincere, that his nature is not simple and single, but
dual, and the consequences to him in his judgment of life
and in his conduct will be of incalculable importance. He
will learn, with a conviction which no science or philosophy
falsely so-called can shake, that beside the passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and wandering desires and blind impulses and the cravings
for pleasure and the prod of sensations, there is something
within him and a part of him, rather in some way his
truer self, which controls and checks and knows and
pronounces judgment, unmoved amid all motion, unchanged
amid continual change, of everlasting validity
above the shifting valuations of the moment. He may not
be able to express this insight in terms that will satisfy his
own reason or will convince others, but if his insight is
true, he will not waver in loyalty to it, though he may sin
against it times without number in spoken word and impulsive
deed. Rather his loyalty will be confirmed by
experience. For he will discover that there is a happiness
of the soul which is not the same as the pleasure of fulfilled
desires, whether these be for good or for ill, a happiness
which is not dependent upon the results of this or
that choice among our desires, but upon the very act itself
of choice and self-control, and which grows with the habit
of staying the throng of besetting and inflicting impulses
always until the judicial <i>fiat</i> has been pronounced. It is
thus that happiness is the final test of morality, bringing
with it a sense of responsibility to the supernatural command
within the soul of the man himself, as binding as
the laws of religion, and based on no disputable revelation
or outer authority. Such a morality is neither old nor
new, and stands above the varying customs of society.
It is not determined essentially by the relation of a man to
his fellows or by their approval, but by the consciousness
of rightness in the man's own breast,&mdash;in a word, by
character. Its works are temperance, truth, honesty,
trustworthiness, fortitude, magnanimity, elevation; and
its crown is joy.</p>

<p>Then, under the guidance of this intuition, a man may
turn his eyes upon the world with no fear of being swayed
by the ephemeral winds of doctrine. Despite the clamor
of the hour he will know that the obligation to society is
not the primal law, and is not the source of personal integrity,
but is secondary to personal integrity. He will believe
that social justice is in itself desirable, but he will
hold that it is far more important to preach first the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
responsibility of each man to himself for his own character.
He will admit that equality of opportunity is an ideal to
be aimed at, but he will think this a small thing in comparison
with the universality of duty. In his attitude towards
mankind he will not deny the claims of sympathy, but he
will listen first to the voice of judgment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away with charity that soothes a lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrusts the truth with scorn and anger by.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He will be sensitive to the vast injustices of life, and its
widespread sorrows, but he will not be seduced by that
compassion into the hypocrisy of saying that "the love
of those whom a man does not know is quite as elemental
a sentiment as the love of those whom a man does know."</p>

<h2>PROFESSOR BERGSON AND THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH</h2>


<p>When, some months since, M. Bergson delivered
his inaugural address as President of the Society
for Psychical Research, the circumstance was considered
of enough importance to justify many cablegrams in the
American papers, and much editorial comment. Had the
address not been in French, it probably would have been
reproduced here. Yet the event was not exceptional
enough for that feature to explain the attention of the
press. Men to be named in the same breath with Professor
Bergson, for instance Professor William James and Mr. Arthur
Balfour, had already been presidents of the Society.
Therefore the importance attached to M. Bergson's acceptance
of the presidency may indicate not merely an interest
in his views of the subjects attacked by the Society, but a
growing interest in the subjects themselves&mdash;perhaps an
interest that may lead such of our readers as have not already
studied them, to welcome some account of both.
The information is doubly worth giving, as there is such a
wide belief that the Society is but a group of cranks, while
in fact it has always included some of the best minds of
the age. This account, however, despite the disproportionate
space we venture to allot to it, can give but a
pitifully inadequate idea of the Society's work, and has
been prepared mainly on the chance that it may lead a few
readers to seek adequate knowledge elsewhere.</p>

<p>There is also a better reason for attention to the subject.
No argument is needed to convince thinking people that
this age stands in peculiar need of a revival, from some
source, of that interest in the mysteries surrounding our
little experience, without which no age has been really
great.</p>

<p>The work hardly seemed worth doing at all unless on
the present scale. If any reader begrudges the space, we
can pretty safely promise that the subject will not call
for so large a proportion in future [Editor].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1882 a group of friends who had been meeting occasionally
at Cambridge for the discussion of mysterious
phenomena, formed the Society for Psychical Research,
and took rooms in London. The best known of the early
members were Professor (now Sir William) Barrett, Professor
Henry Sidgwick, Frederick W. H. Myers, Fellow of
Cambridge, Arthur J. Balfour, Richard Holt Hutton
(Editor of <i>The Spectator</i>); Professor Balfour Stewart, Hensleigh
Wedgwood, Lord Houghton and Archbishop Trench.
They were soon joined by, among others, Professor (now
Sir William) Crookes, Alfred Russel Wallace, Lord Raleigh,
Ruskin, Tennyson, William James, Edmund Gurney,
Richard Hodgson, Frank Podmore, Professor (now Sir
Oliver) Lodge, and Professor Schiller.</p>

<p>The Society's Proceedings now fill twenty-six octavo
volumes, and it has also published a Journal for its members
which has reached fifteen large twelvemo volumes.</p>

<p>All were originally published in "parts," of which, in
all but two or three cases, several composed a volume.
Any portion of the material can be obtained from the
Society's American agents, the W. B. Clarke Co. of Boston.</p>

<p>The topic first reported on by the society was thought-transference.
Experiments were made with cards, words,
pictures and all sorts of objects. The Society published
scores, possibly hundreds, of pairs of drawings, one of
each pair having been made by a person not seeing the
original, who had copied it closely enough to be recognized,
in consequence of willing to copy it, and being similarly
willed by another person drawing or gazing at it. Some
of the duplicates would have been very fair performances
even if the originals had been in sight.</p>

<p>The conviction before existing that all sorts of impressions
could be conveyed at the will of a hypnotist, was
abundantly confirmed, and a strong conviction was
aroused in some minds, and it seems to be increasing, that
all transference of thought without visible means has a
hypnotic element, and is much more frequent than yet
generally recognized.</p>

<p>Pictures were of course conveyed as subjective visions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and the Society began very early to collect and classify
accounts of visions of all kinds, applying rigid canons of
verification.</p>

<p>In 1886 the Society published a collection of "Phantasms
of the Living" compiled by Gurney, Myers and
Podmore. Seven hundred cases were thought sufficiently
verified to be worth including.</p>

<p>This work was severely criticised by Mr. Charles Pearce
in the Proceedings of a short-lived American society, and
he was there answered by Mr. Gurney.</p>

<p>Gurney died while preparing a work on Phantasms of
the Dead. His material was put in shape by Myers, and
published in the Proceedings of the Society, Vol. V,
pp. 403f. "Phantasms of the Living" is now out of print
but much of its material is obtainable in Journal I and
the Reports of the Literary Committee in the early volumes
of the Proceedings.</p>

<p>Space does not admit of enough citation and discussion
from these works to be of value. It may be said in general,
however, that with one class of partial exceptions,
there is hardly any ghost story that one has ever heard of
which does not find its parallel here, confirmed by excellent
witnesses and often by considerable supplementary
investigation. The partial exceptions are the stories of
freezing horror which, the evidence now suggests, would
appear to have little, if any, basis in actual experience, but
to be mainly the products of imagination&mdash;often of deliberate
imagination laboring for dramatic effect. The
authenticated phenomena are generally of gentle and
innocuous character&mdash;appearance of dying friends, etc.
There are some apparently of troubled souls, but hardly
ever of malevolent ones.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the experiences have taken place
in bed, and therefore are presumably dreams, and there is
much reason to believe that the others come in some sort
of a dream state, the whole business probably being associated,
as before indicated, with telepathy, and telepathy
probably being associated with hypnotism, not always
voluntary or conscious.</p>

<p>The experiences are apparently of sight, sound, touch&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the senses. And yet in connection with visions, there
have been few changes in objective Nature to account for
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much regarding hypnotism was published in the early
volumes, but that subject is now so much a part of the
knowledge of the medical world, and even the world in
general, that we will not enlarge upon it here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As there have "always" been stories of visions and hypnotic
control, so there have been stories of objects moved
by human beings without the exercise of muscular force,
and indeed without contact. Years before the foundation
of the S. P. R., the present writer saw a conclusive illustration
of the first. It was an exhibition of something to
which it might be well to transfer the name of zoömagnetism,
which was originally suggested by Dr. Liebault
for the force assumed to act in hypnotism. That assumption
is now abandoned. For the effects of the force&mdash;the
manifestations to the senses, the name telekinesis is
accepted by the Society.</p>

<p>This zoömagnetic force with telekinetic effects seems
quite plainly a mode of the cosmic energy. Putting it
forth generally leaves the agent much exhausted, although
very strangely in one of the best accounts, in Pr. S. P. R.
VII, 175f. by Professor Alexander, of the University of
Rio Janiero, regarding his neighbors the Davis children's
performance, he says that they were not fatigued. This
seems like a denial of the persistence of force. But there
may be a force manifested by the human system and yet
not generated in it (or appropriated by it from food and
air), but merely passing through it, as some classes of
thoughts are held by some students to be entirely independent
of human origination. If so, there are <i>two</i> modes
of force as yet uncorrelated with our knowledge, which
produce telekinetic effects: for there is certainly one which
exhausts human energies. (See Pr. VI, VII, IX, XII.)</p>

<p>Perhaps a more certain correlation of the zoömagnetic
force with the modes of force already well correlated, is
that, if the evidence collected by the S. P. R. is reliable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
it is, like them, mutable into the production of light&mdash;including
the alleged magnetic aura, even around persons&mdash;sound,
electricity and the other modes of force
already well known. (See Pr. IV, VIII, IX, XI.) These
modes possibly include that which moves the dowser's rod.
But as we know of no case where a dowser has manifested
any of the more definitely correlated modes of zoömagnetic
force, the chance of dowsing being one is small. Much information
regarding dowsing, which convinced several
eminent scientists&mdash;Sir William Barrett among them, is
published by the Society in Pr. II, XIII, XV. Moreover,
there is evidence (Jour. IX, Pr. XV), so far as it goes,
that the zoömagnetic force can <i>resist</i> heat, not only in the
Fijian "fire walk," but in London drawing-rooms in the
person of the medium Home, but in him alone&mdash;that it has
enabled him and many others to counteract the effects of
gravity upon their own persons; and to "materialize,"
that is to produce on the senses of other people, possibly
by hypnotizing several at once, without the aid of matter
as we know it, the impressions of light, sound, resistance
and pressure which ordinarily indicate the presence of the
living human body, when no such object in the ordinary
sense is actually present. (For all this see Jour. VI, Pr.
VI, IX.)</p>

<p>The Society investigated the display of these phenomena
by many agents, among them the notorious Eusapia
Palladino. Her working in the dark and with a "cabinet"
and other apparatus favorable for fraud, was of course
against her, but it seems the unescapable conclusion that
of her phenomena some were genuine&mdash;and some fraudulent.
With unintelligent and uneducated mediums, the
doctrine "falsus in uno falsus in omnibus" does not hold:
for such mediums, often, sometimes involuntarily, eke out
the lion's skin with the fox's.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The records of the Society contain much evidence of a
connection between telekinetic power and the telepsychic
power of conveying thought already described. Perhaps
Mrs. Piper is the only well known medium not manifesting
both. The two powers are shown together in tipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
furniture or producing sounds or lights to signal yes
and no; and while the alphabet is being enunciated,
to mark letters so as to spell out significant words and
sentences. There is strong reason to believe that the intelligence
in these indications has been generally that of
the operator, often acting involuntarily and entirely
honestly, and sometimes, especially in the case of "planchette,"
that of some other person present, acting telepathically
through the operator. (Pr. VII, IX, XI.)</p>

<p>Of course there has not been the slightest necessity of
attributing any of these queer manifestations of zoömagnetism
to "spirits," and, despite one or two exceptions
(notably the late Stainton Moses), the members of the
Society for Psychical Research have not so attributed
them. But the average man has attributed all mysterious
things to spirits, ever since the primitive times when everything
was mysterious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unfortunately, two of the most remarkable mediums,
perhaps the most remarkable, Foster and Home, were too
early to come directly under the investigation of the
S. P. R. as a body; but fortunately Sir William Crookes
did come into association with Home in the early Seventies
before the foundation of the Society, tested his zoömagnetism
many times in the laboratory, with entirely satisfactory
results, and later gave the Society the results of his observations,
which were published in Journals VI and IX,
and Pr. VI, IX and XV. Of course his testimony to a laboratory
experiment is the last word, but many of his accounts
of social sittings with Home stagger belief, and
tempt an impression that there must have been hypnosis
somewhere. But the Proceedings contain considerable
collateral evidence. And Myers and Sir William Barrett
applied "the higher criticism" to Home's autobiography
and his wife's accounts of him, and published the results,
which were favorable, in Jour. IV, VI.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But while the evidence for the things already recounted
here was pouring in, there came evidence too strong to be
thrown aside without examination, of things harder to
attribute to any incarnate power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Home's accordeon, we are told by no less an authority
than Sir William Crookes, and by several others (Pr.
Vol. VI), was often played intelligently and beautifully
without the apparent agency of human hands; and the
inspirational writing which in earlier times had come from
overwrought religious mystics, began to appear from people
who were by no means overwrought or mystical, or
even religious, though the most noted of them was. This
was the Rev. W. Stainton Moses, the first remarkable
medium who associated freely with the members of the
Society. It is alleged that he manifested movement of
objects without contact, lights, sounds in both the air and
material objects, levitation and materialization&mdash;all the
modes of zoömagnetism except resistance to heat&mdash;assuming
that to be one of them. His molecular telekineses
indicated intelligence.</p>

<p>Myers says (Pr. IX, 250f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1882 he aided in the foundation of the Society for Psychical
Research; but he left that body in 1886, on account of its
attitude towards Spiritualism, which he regarded as unduly critical....
Many members of the Society held an intellectual
position widely differing from that of Mr. Moses, and
although his own published records were of a kind not easily
credible, no suspicion as to his personal probity and veracity
was ever, so far as I know, either expressed or entertained.</p>

<p>"... [Moses] was very reticent about exhibiting his powers,
and consequently almost the only records are his own and
those of his physician, Dr. Stanhope Speer, Mrs. Speer, and
their son, Mr. Charlton T. Speer, Associate of the Royal Academy
of Music&mdash;all persons of undoubted capacity and probity....
Dr. Speer's cast of mind was thoroughly materialistic,
and it is remarkable that his interest in Mr. Moses'
phenomena was from first to last of a purely scientific, as contrasted
with an emotional or religious nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are half a dozen other good witnesses, however.</p>

<p>Despite Moses' telepsychic telekineses, his principal
alleged communications with the spirit world were by automatic
(we prefer to call it heteromatic) writing. Of this
he left twenty-four note books. The writings in these were
in several different hands and bore the marks of as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
different characters, that were never mixed up. They
signed the names, Imperator, Rector, Doctor, etc., and
declared their earthly selves to have been various eminent
persons in the remote past.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We shall find later that after Moses' death, his alleged
spirit gave an entirely different set of names for the earthly
originals of these alleged personalities. Myers, having
seen all the heteromatic writing, tacitly endorses Moses'
statements regarding its visible qualities. Moses continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By degrees I found that many spirits who were unable to influence
my hand themselves sought the aid of a spirit 'Rector'
[a gentleman whom we shall meet often. Editor of this article],
who was apparently able to write more freely and with less
strain on me;</p></blockquote>

<p>He says that they differed from him and criticised him
severely, but ultimately converted him to a higher faith
than the Anglicanism he had previously preached.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Myers comments (Pr. XI, 69):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The tone of the spirits towards Mr. Moses himself is habitually
courteous and respectful. But occasionally they have some
criticism which pierces to the quick, and which goes far to explain
to me Mr. Moses's unwillingness to have the books fully
inspected during his lifetime."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have no space for any of this script, and it probably
would not tend much to edification if we had. After a
good deal of reading and pondering, I find the proportion
of Moses' self in all these proceedings looming in my
apprehension larger and larger. The benefits he got from
them look to me like that portion&mdash;how large a portion I
am not saying&mdash;of the benefits of prayer which are independent
of external results, and consist in the effect upon
character of intense absorption in an inspiring subject.</p>

<p>Myers testifies that Moses' heteromatic writing announced
the death of a friend of Myers before it could
have been known by other means, and that the writing
closely resembled hers. Moses himself declares, and many
fairly judicious people believed him, that among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
marvels, the writing told him, in advance of any other
possible agency, of the death of President Garfield, and
of a suicide in London under a steam roller. The latter
statement has several confirmatory witnesses.</p>

<p>The account of Moses is given here, not so much because
of himself, as to prepare for later appearances of
Imperator, Rector, Doctor &amp; Co., which will be of more
interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In America there was of course not leisure enough to
continue the Am. S. P. R., which had been started a
couple of years after the English one, and it was merged
with the English Society, becoming a "branch." In 1887
Dr. Richard Hodgson, who had been lecturing at Cambridge,
was sent over as secretary to take charge of it, and
soon began a set of experiences which immeasurably surpass
all others in connection with the subject.</p>

<p>In 1886, Professor William James had found a remarkable
medium in Mrs. Piper, a New England woman of
average position and education, and Dr. Hodgson devoted
himself to her phenomena. In trance she spoke as a self-alleged
French physician who called himself Dr. Jean
Phinuit Schliville, and who professed to be in the other
world in association with friends of people who came to
sit with Mrs. Piper. Dr. Phinuit professed to give messages
from them, and to deliver the sitters' messages to
them. The only thing apparently unprecedented in these
proceedings was the consistently dramatic character of
Dr. Phinuit himself, and the verisimilitude, varying but
often astounding, between the utterances, dramatic characterizations
and recollections of the alleged message
senders, and the persons as known in life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Piper's career with Dr. Phinuit was an inheritance
by her from a Dr. Cocke, who was controlled by a Dr.
Finney. Dr. Cocke was an "inspirational healer" and in
1884 Mrs. Piper went to consult him about some physical
ailment. A circle was being held, and she joined it. On a
second visit she experienced a sensation as of a blinding
flash, and then fainted, and on recovering began to talk in
trance as somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Hodgson says (Pr. VIII, 46f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She was said to have been controlled by an Indian girl who
gave the name 'Chlorine,' and to have given a remarkable test
to a stranger who was present. She had several more sittings
with Mr. Cocke, and was again controlled, apparently on each
occasion by 'Chlorine.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This name is evidently pitched upon on account of its
euphony and apparent femininity, by some consciousness&mdash;we
can't tell whose, perhaps Mrs. Piper's subliminal
(whatever that may mean)&mdash;unaware of the meaning
of the word, which I hardly need tell the reader usually
refers to a rather fetid gas. Hodgson continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She was also ostensibly controlled at occasional times by Mrs.
Siddons, Bach, Longfellow, Commodore Vanderbilt, and Loretta
Ponchini. It was said that 'Mrs. Siddons' recited a scene from
Macbeth, Longfellow was said to have written some verses, and
Loretta Ponchini (who purported to be an Italian girl) to have
made some drawings....</p>

<p>"Dr. Phinuit only came at first to give medical advice. He
'didn't care to come for other matters,' as he thought them 'too
<i>trivial</i>.'</p>

<p>"Finally Sebastian Bach said they were going to concentrate
all their powers on Phinuit, and he became ultimately the chief
control.</p>

<p>"Mr. Piper says that there is no question but that it is the
same Phinuit or personality who controls Dr. Cocke, no matter
how their names are spelt."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this seems clap-trap, but wait.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The questions regarding Phinuit are different from
those regarding most of the other controls in the Society's
records: for, with the exception of the Imperator group,
they, in ordinary life, were generally known, personally or
historically, to the sitters; while Phinuit has loomed upon
the world as free from origins as Melchizedek, and some
people think, despite his lack of priestly ways, with as
important a mission. But he has alleged a lot of origins
that, so far, cannot be traced. Even, however, if they
never can be, the fact would not prove that he never
existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while the communications began to be occasionally
in writing, and at times the voice would be speaking
as Phinuit, and the hand writing as somebody else.
There was at least one occasion (Pr. XIII, 293) when
Phinuit was joking with a lot of young girls, and the hand
writing on other subjects with Dr. Hodgson.</p>

<p>The records of the S. P. R. contain the most contradictory
accounts of Phinuit's character and attainments.
Several habitual sitters are very fond of him. He and Sir
Oliver Lodge were intimate friends, and while I have had
but one conversation with him, I find reading him as
delightful as reading Falstaff. Yet Professor Shaler calls
him a preposterous scoundrel, as was Falstaff; but I can't
find serious dishonesty in Phinuit.</p>

<p>Professor William James, who went to school in French
Switzerland, and was entirely at home in French, says
Phinuit knew none. Other sitters agree with him. Mr.
Rogers Rich, who was equally at home in the language,
says he and Phinuit talked French together a good deal, to
Mr. Rich's entire satisfaction. Other sitters indicate the
same. Mrs. Piper knew no French. Mr. Rich and many
sitters, including Sir Oliver Lodge, in whose family Dr.
Phinuit practiced extensively, found benefit in his prescriptions;
he successfully gave one treatment which seems
to the lay mind the opposite of reasonable, and yet I myself
found prompt relief through a similar one given by an
eminent New York physician. Nevertheless there are
those who call Phinuit a shameless quack. While in the
Pr. S. P. R. there are several prescriptions by him in correct
technical language, there are also several statements
that he does not know the ordinary terms of the pharmacopeia.</p>

<p>The following particulars are taken from a report on
Mrs. Piper's trance which Hodgson made to the S. P. R.
in 1892 published in Vol. VIII of their Proceedings.
Although the messages generally went through Dr. Phinuit,
sometimes the alleged personages themselves took
control and carried on conversations with their friends
through the vocal organs and gestures of Mrs. Piper. The
voices of the controls varied with the alleged personalities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>R. Hodgson. First Sitting. May 4th, 1887.</i> (Pr. VIII, 60.)</p>

<p>[From notes made on return to my rooms immediately after
the sitting.]</p>

<p>"Phinuit began, after the usual introduction, by describing
[correctly] members of my family....</p>

<p>"Phinuit mentioned the name 'Fred.' ... 'He says you
went to school together. He goes on jumping-frogs, and
laughs.... He had convulsive movements before his death,
struggles. He went off in a sort of spasm.... [My cousin
Fred far excelled any other person that I have seen in the games
of leap-frog, fly the garter, etc.... He injured his spine in
a gymnasium ... lingered for a fortnight, with occasional
spasmodic convulsions, in one of which he died.] Phinuit described
a lady, in general terms, dark hair, dark eyes, slim figure,
etc., and said she was much closer to me than any other person:
that she 'died slowly.' ... She had two rings; one was buried
with her body; the other ought to have gone to you. The second
part of her first name is&mdash;sie.' [True, with the exception of the
statement about the rings, which may or may not be true....
No ring ever passed between the lady and myself.... After
trying in vain to 'hear distinctly' the first part of the name,
Phinuit gave up the attempt, and asked me what the first name
was. I told him. I shall refer to it afterwards as 'Q.']"</p></blockquote>

<p>All this could well have been involuntary telepathy from
Hodgson to the medium. But again, wait.</p>

<p>At Hodgson's second sitting, November 18th, 1887,
Phinuit referred to the beautiful teeth of "Q." and Hodgson
says: "'Q.'s' teeth were not beautiful."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is something better (Pr. VIII):</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">"5, Boylston-place, <i>March 6th, 1889</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Robertson James has just called here on return from a
sitting with Mrs. P., during which he was informed by Mrs.
P.&mdash;entranced&mdash;that 'Aunt Kate' had died about 2 or 2.30 in
the morning. Aunt Kate was also referred to as Mrs. Walsh.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Walsh has been ill for some time and has been expected
during the last few days to die at any hour. This is written before
any despatch has been received informing of the death, in
presence of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Richard Hodgson.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">William James.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Robertson James.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On reaching home an hour later I found a telegram as follows:&mdash;'Aunt
Kate passed away a few minutes after midnight.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E.
R. Walsh.</span>'</p>

<p class="right">"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Wm. James</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. William James, who accompanied Mr. Robertson
James to the sitting on March 6th, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">"18, Garden-street, <span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, <i>March 28th, 1889</i>.</p>

<p>"Concerning the sitting mentioned above on March 6th, I
may add that the 'control' said, when mentioning that Aunt
Kate had died, that I would find 'a letter or telegram' when I
got home, saying she was gone.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Alice H. James.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now all this seems quite possibly telepathy and coincidence.
But how about this?</p>

<blockquote><p class="right">"<i>July, 1890.</i></p>

<p>"Early at this sitting I inquired, 'How is Aunt Kate?' The
reply was, 'She is poorly.' This reply disappointed me, from its
baldness. Nothing more was said about Aunt Kate till towards
the close of the sitting, when I again said, 'Can you tell me nothing
more about Aunt Kate?' The medium suddenly threw back
her head and said in a startled way, 'Why, Aunt Kate's here.
All round me I hear voices saying, "Aunt Kate has come."'
Then followed the announcement that she had died very early
that morning, and on being pressed to give the time, shortly
after two was named.</p>

<p class="right">"A. H. J."</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is a manifestation eight months after Mrs.
Walsh's death:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>R. Hodgson. November 7th, 1889.</i> (Pr. VIII, 93-4.)</p>

<p>[From a letter written to Professor W. James on the day of
the sitting.]</p>

<p>"Mrs. D. and I had sitting to-day at Arlington Heights, and
the usurpation by 'Kate Walsh' was extraordinary. The personality
seemed very intense, and spoke in effortful whispers.</p>

<p>"'William&mdash;William&mdash;God bless you.' Sitter: 'Who are
you?' 'Kate&mdash;Walsh.' (S. 'I know you.') 'Help me&mdash;help
me&mdash;&mdash;' [Taking (<i>i. e.</i>, Mrs. Piper "taking," &amp;c. Ed.) my
right hand with her right, and passing it to her left and making
me take hold of her left hand.] 'That hand's dead&mdash;dead&mdash;this
one's alive' [<i>i. e.</i>, the right]&mdash;'help me.'</p>

<p>"The left hand ... was cooler than either of my hands,
while the right hand was warmer than either of my hands [the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
implication being that Mrs. Piper was possessed by Mrs. Walsh.
Ed.]</p>

<p>"I'm alive&mdash;I'm alive&mdash;Albert's coming over soon. He
can't stay&mdash;poor boy&mdash;poor boy&mdash;Albert&mdash;Albert&mdash;Alfred&mdash;Albert&mdash;I
know you&mdash;Alice&mdash;Alice&mdash;William&mdash;Alice&mdash;&mdash;'
(S. 'Yes, I know. I'll tell them. You remember me. I stayed
with you in New York.') 'Yes, I know. But, oh, I can't remember.
I'm so cold&mdash;I'm so cold. Oh, help me&mdash;help me'&mdash;[making
tremulous movements of hands]. (S. 'I know. I'll tell
them. You remember me; my name's Hodgson.') 'Yes. Mr.
Hodgson. Where are the girls? Yes. You had fish for breakfast
on the second day, didn't you?' (S. 'I don't remember very
well.') 'And the tea&mdash;who was it spilt the cup of tea? Was it
you or William?' [I think I remember something about the tea,
but not very clearly. R. H.] 'You were in the corner room&mdash;bedroom&mdash;upstairs.
Were you cold? Then there was some
blancmange&mdash;you didn't like that. No. It was cream&mdash;Bavarian
cream. [Is all this Mrs. Piper, or is it Shakspere, or
is it the spirit of a fussy old lady? Ed.] Albert&mdash;poor boy; he's
coming soon. William&mdash;[something about arranging the property]&mdash;William&mdash;God
bless him.'</p>

<p>"The above was much less than was really said. But that was
the sort of thing, and nothing <i>à la mode</i> Phinuit at all. It was
the most strikingly personal thing I have seen."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, some commentators want us to believe, was still
"another personality" of Mrs. Piper&mdash;if Phinuit was.
Four in the case of Sallie Beauchamp are well established,
and nine in the case of Dr. Wilcox's patient. I wonder
how many Dr. Prince would consider a probable number,
and at what number the spiritistic hypothesis would begin
to appear easier than the divided personality one. All
unquestionable cases of secondary personality that I know
of do not cross the sex, and are the results of brain injury
or disease. Mrs. Piper and most of the mediums are normal
people, and do their best when physically at their best.</p>

<p>The following report (Pr. VIII, 126f.) by Mr. T. Rogers
Rich, a well known artist of Boston, made from contemporary
notes of the sittings, is among the best:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My first sitting with her was on September 6th, 1888. With
little trouble she went into the trance ... and after a moment's
silence ... I was startled by the remarkable change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
in her voice&mdash;an exclamation, a sort of grunt of satisfaction,
as if the person had reached his destination and gave vent
to his pleasure thereat by this sound, uttered in an unmistakably
male voice, but rather husky. I was at once addressed in French
with, 'Bonjour, Monsieur, comment vous portez vous?' to which
I gave answer in the same language, with which I happen to be
perfectly familiar. My answer was responded to with a sort of
inquiring grunt, much like the French 'Hein?'.... Nearly
all my interviews were begun in the same manner.... I
was quite unwell with nervous troubles.... The first thing
told me was of a 'great light behind me, a good sign,' &amp;c.
Then suddenly all my ills were very clearly and distinctly explained
and so thoroughly that I felt certain that Mrs. Piper
herself would have hesitated to use such plain language! Prescriptions
were given to me...."</p>

<p>"<i>Second Sitting on October 5th.</i>&mdash;... The 'Doctor' told
me of my niece being frequently 'in my surroundings,' and that
she was then at my side. Up to this time I had not heard my
name mentioned, so I asked for it from my niece. The 'Doctor'
was again puzzled and said, 'What a funny name&mdash;wait, I cannot
go so fast!' Then my entire name was correctly spelt out
but entirely with the French alphabet, each separate letter being
clearly pronounced in that language. My niece had been born,
lived most of her short life, and died in France. Then the attempt
to pronounce my name was amusing&mdash;finally calling me
'Thames Rowghearce Reach.' The 'Doctor' never called me
after that anything but 'Reach.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The spelling of a name "entirely with the French alphabet,
each separate letter being clearly pronounced in that
language," is a feat that few English-speaking students
could accomplish, because the matter is of little consequence,
and generally neglected. I have been in France
some, and have translated two French books without incurring
critical censure that I am aware of, and yet that
feat would be far beyond me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One day Mrs. Piper pointed to a plain gold ring on my finger
and said: 'C'est une alliance, how you call that? A wedding
ring, n'est-ce pas?' This was true. Now if Mrs. Piper had
learned French at school here [which she did not or anywhere
else. Ed.] she would most probably have called this ring
'un anneau de marriage,' and not have given it the technical
name 'alliance.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many cases of mediums speaking in languages
which they did not know, but which the control,
when incarnate, did. Mr. Rich continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Breaking into the run of conversation, the 'Doctor' of a sudden
said, 'Hullo, here's Newell!' [pseudonym] (mentioning the
name of a friend who had died some months before)....
'Newell' had frequently purported to communicate directly
with his mother through Mrs. Piper at previous sittings, but this
was the first time that any intimation of his presence was given
to me. I was totally unprepared for this, and said, 'Who did
you say?' The name was repeated with a strong foreign accent,
and in the familiar voice and tone of the 'Doctor.' Then there
seemed for a moment to be a mingling of voices as if in dispute,
followed by silence and heavy breathing of the medium. All at
once I was astonished to hear, in an entirely different tone and
in the purest English accent, 'Well, of all persons under the sun,
Rogers Rich, what brought you here? I'm glad to see you, old
fellow! How is X and Y and Z, and all the boys at the club?'
Some names were given which I knew of, but their owners I had
never met, and so reminded my friend 'Newell,' who recalled
that he followed me in college by some years and that all his
acquaintances were younger than I. I remarked an odd movement
of the medium while under this influence; she apparently
was twirling a mustache, a trick which my friend formerly practised
much."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now if all this drama is telepathy, it certainly is not of
the "common or garden variety," and if "Newell" is a
secondary personality of Mrs. Piper, it is one of hundreds
of instances of that woman having secondary personalities
who are men. I have read accounts of a good many undoubted
cases of secondary personality, and have yet to
read of one where the sex was crossed. Aren't these interpretations
growing to look a little absurd? Mr. Rich
goes on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>June 3rd, 1889.</i>&mdash;This time I asked to communicate with
my friend 'Newell.' ... The 'Doctor' said, 'I'll send for him,'
and kept on talking with me for a while. Then he said, 'Here's
Newell, and he wants to talk with you "Reach," so I'll go about
my business whilst you are talking with him, and will come back
again later.' ... My name was called clearly as 'Rogers, old
fellow!' without a sign of accent [Remember that 'Phinuit'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
always pronounced it with an accent. Ed.] and the same questions
put as to how were the 'fellows at the club.' My hand
was cordially shaken [by the medium. Ed.], and I remarked
the same movement of twisting the mustache, ... When
'Newell' left me there was the usual disturbance in the medium's
condition, and then the resumption of the familiar voice, accent
and mannerisms of Dr. Phinuit...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Rich continues (Pr. VIII, 130):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I produced a dog's collar. After some handling of it [by the
medium] the 'Doctor' recognized it as belonging to a dog which
I had once owned. I asked 'If there were dogs where he was?'
'Thousands of them!' and he said he would try to attract the attention
of my dog with this collar. In the midst of our conversation
he suddenly exclaimed, 'There! I think he knows you are
here, for I see [him] coming from away off!' He then described
my collie perfectly, and said, '<i>You</i> call him, Reach,' and I gave
my whistle by which I used to call him. 'Here he comes! Oh,
how he jumps! There he is now, jumping upon and around you.
So glad to see you! Rover! Rover! No&mdash;G-rover, Grover!
That's his name!' The dog was once called Rover, but his name
was changed to Grover in 1884, in honor of the election of Grover
Cleveland."</p></blockquote>

<p>The knowledge here may have been telepathic, but how
about the dramatization?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Piper's English Sittings of 1889-90 were held under
the supervision of Sir Oliver Lodge and Dr. Walter Leaf,
and the report of them has an introduction by Myers, and
is followed by a statement of impressions of Mrs. Piper by
James. All these experts expressed perfect confidence in
the honesty of the medium, and that the phenomena were
not explicable by any agency yet known to science.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge says (Pr. VI, 445):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The details given of my family are just such as one might
imagine obtained by a perfect stranger surrounded by the whole
of one's relations in a group and able to converse freely but
hastily with one after the other; not knowing them and being
rather confused with their number and half-understood messages
and personalities, and having a special eye to their physical
weaknesses and defects. [Phinuit was (?) a doctor. Ed.]
A person in a hurry thus trying to tell a stranger as much about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
his friends as he could in this way gather, would seem to me to be
likely to make much the same kind of communication as was
actually made to me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is an episode explaining a nickname that Phinuit
habitually applied to Sir Oliver (Pr. VI, 471f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cousin married, and the gentleman passed out at sea,
round the sea.... Hullo, he's got funny buttons, big,
bright.... A uniform. He has been a commander, an
officer, a leader; not military, but a commander.... [A
little further on Phinuit suddenly brings out the word Cap'n
in connection with him, but, in a curious and half puzzled way,
applies it to me. It remained my Phinuit nickname to the end,
though quite inapplicable.] Your mother has got a good picture
of him taken a long time ago, pretty good, old-fashioned, but not
so bad of him. Yes, pretty good. He looks like that now. He
looks younger than he did...."</p></blockquote>

<p>As in this vision, so it was in one of my own dreams
which I suspect was in several respects veridical; and in
two other dreams where I cannot trace any veridicity:
the persons had grown young.</p>

<p>This recalls Peter Ibbetson's statement that he and his
beloved kept themselves about twenty-seven. There are
reports that Peter Ibbetson is not all fancy, but even if
it were, such reports would be inevitable.</p>

<p>But in another dream which I fully believe to have been
veridical, the person had grown older in proportion to the
time since "passing over," but there was a peculiar reason
for such a manifestation: I fancy that my friend may have
wanted to appear to "grow old with me."</p>

<p>There are some things to suggest that if there are post-carnate
souls, they can appear as of any age in their experience&mdash;and
so show their history since separation, to
anyone rejoining them.</p>

<p>Edmund Gurney, author of "Phantasms of the Living,"
and a very active member of the S. P. R. died in 1888.
In December, 1889, his ostensible spirit communicated at
several sittings with Sir Oliver Lodge through Mrs. Piper.
Sir Oliver says (Pr. XXIII, 141f.):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I learned in this way more about the life and thoughts of
Edmund Gurney than I had known in his lifetime."</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mrs. Piper knew less. Then where did it come
from? These Gurney sittings are very interesting and
suggestive, but we can use our limited space to better
advantage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here are some characteristic Phinuit Touches (Pr. VI,
484):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She remembers more than you do. What do you think she
says to me? She says, don't swear, doctor; she did, sure as you
live....</p>

<p>"Dr.: 'Do you know who Jerry&mdash;J&mdash;E&mdash;R&mdash;R&mdash;Y&mdash;is?'
O. L.: 'Yes. Tell him I want to hear from him.' U[ncle]
J[erry. Ed.]: 'Tell Robert, [his brother] Jerry still lives. I
will be very glad to hear from me. This is my watch. Uncle
Jerry&mdash;my watch.'...</p>

<p>"P.: 'I say, Captain, your friends have a lot to tell you,
they're just clamoring to get at you. Why the devil don't you
give them a chance?' O. L.: 'Well, I will next time.' (Watch
handled again. It was a repeater, and happened to go off.)
P.: 'Hullo, I didn't do that. Jerry did that, to remind you of
him. Here, take it away&mdash;it goes springing off&mdash;it's alive.' ...
'It was Uncle Jerry, the one that had the fall. I'll bring you
some more news of him. Give me back his nine-shooter.'
(Meaning the watch.)"</p></blockquote>

<p>Phinuit and the Lodge family and their next-door
neighbors, the Thompsons, got to be great friends. Phinuit
had given them much good advice, professional and
other, and had really been of considerable service to them,
even if only through their imaginations.</p>

<p>At the end of their second series of sittings, Feb. 23,
1890, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, all you people come here. Good-by, Susie. Good-by,
Ike. Good-by, Nelly. Now, all clear out and let me talk to
Marie. (Long conversation of a paternal kind, with thoroughly
sensible advice. Then O. L. returned.) Captain, it's not good-by,
it's <i>au revoir</i>, and you shall hear of me when I've gone
away.' O. L.: 'How can I?' P.: 'Oh, I will tell some gentleman
a message and he will write it for me. You'll see.</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir, au revoir, &amp;c.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Hodgson's inclination while writing his report, was to
attribute the phenomena to telepathy from the sitter.
This might account for a part of the knowledge which the
medium displayed, but it did not account for knowledge
which the sitter never had, but left such knowledge to be
accounted for by the vastly less probable hypothesis of
teloteropathy from absent persons, which begins to approach
the improbability of spiritism itself. But after the
medium's possession of the knowledge is accounted for,
the main problem is yet to be approached. Knowledge of
a particular circumstance is virtually the same in all
minds possessing it. But after a medium, say Mrs. Piper,
has obtained an item of knowledge from, let it be granted
for argument's sake, the sitter's mind, what makes her
emotional attitude regarding it not that of the sitter or of
herself, but of some departed friend of the sitter? What
makes her rejoice in it or regret it as this departed friend,
alone among all intelligences, would? What makes the
play of her mind regarding it&mdash;suggestion, response, appreciation
or depreciation, comment and discussion of all
kinds, just what would be that of the departed soul which
professes to be speaking through her? And what makes all
this occur with a fidelity to the character and situation
worthy of the greatest dramatists? And how comes that
average New England woman to display that supreme
dramatic genius virtually every day for a generation?
This is not telepathy or teloteropathy. When Hodgson
wrote his first report, he and the researchers generally
had not got as far as the questions raised by the
dramatic features. But he closed with the following mysterious
paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The foregoing report is based upon sittings not later than
1891. Mrs. Piper has given some sittings very recently which
materially strengthen the evidence for the existence of some
faculty that goes beyond thought-transference from the sitters,
and which certainly <i>primâ facie</i> appear to render some form of
the 'spiritistic' hypothesis more plausible. I hope to discuss
these among other results in a later article."</p></blockquote>

<p>The occasion for this paragraph was made plain in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
next report, issued in 1898, and published in Pr. S. P. R.,
Vol. XIII.</p>

<p>A young man alluded to in the S. P. R. reports as George
Pelham, had died. He was a member of a very prominent
English family, and on the distaff side, of an equally
prominent family in New York. He had graduated at
Harvard and spent some years as a housemate with the
Howards (pseudonym) in Boston, though he died in New
York, after some later years passed there. He was well
known to the present writer, who finds the utterances
of his alleged post-carnate self entirely in character. He
was of a very philosophic bent, and no mean writer in both
prose and verse. Psychical research was by no means his
most prominent interest, or Hodgson his most intimate
friend, though he had discussed the subject several times
with Hodgson, and been introduced by him, under a pseudonym,
for a single sitting with Mrs. Piper. For a month
after G. P.'s death Hodgson's regular sittings with Mrs.
Piper went on without there being any manifestation professing
to come from G. P., when Mr. John Hart (pseudonym)
who had been much more intimate with G. P. than
Hodgson had, was sitting, in Hodgson's presence, with
Mrs. Piper, and after Phinuit had announced a "George,"
an uncle of Mr. Hart, he went on, as Hodgson reports
(Pr. XIII, 297f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is another George who wants to speak to you. How
many Georges are there about you any way? [Hodgson continues.
Ed.]</p>

<p>"The rest of the sitting, until almost the close, was occupied
by statements from G. P., Phinuit acting as intermediary.
George Pelham's real name was given in full, also the
names, both Christian and surname, of several of his most intimate
friends, including the name of the sitter. Moreover, incidents
were referred to which were unknown to the sitter or myself.
One of the pair of studs which J. H. was wearing was given
to Phinuit [<i>i. e.</i> to the medium. Ed.].... '(Who gave them
to me?) [Throughout these sittings, the sitters' remarks are in
parentheses. Ed.] That's mine. Mother gave you that. (No.)
Well, father then, father and mother together. You got those
after I passed out. Mother took them. Gave them to father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and father gave them to you. I want you to keep them. I will
them to you.' Mr. Hart notes: 'The studs were sent to me by
Mr. Pelham as a remembrance of his son....</p>

<p>"James and Mary [Mr. and Mrs.] Howard [Pseudonyms.
Ed.] were mentioned with strongly specific references, and in
connection with Mrs. Howard came the name Katharine. 'Tell
her, she'll know. I will solve the problems, Katharine.' Mr.
Hart notes: 'George, when he had last stayed with [the Howards],
had talked frequently with Katharine (a girl of fifteen
years of age) upon such subjects as Time, Space, God, Eternity,
and pointed out to her how unsatisfactory the commonly accepted
solutions were. He added that some time he would solve
the problems.' Mr. Hart added that he was entirely unaware of
these circumstances. I was myself unaware of them, and was not
at that time acquainted with the Howards.</p></blockquote>

<p>No telepathy then. Phinuit continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Who's Rogets? [Phinuit tries to spell the real name.]
(Spell that again.) [At the first attempt afterwards Phinuit
leaves out a letter, then spells it correctly.] Rogers....
Rogers has got a book of mine. (What is he going to do with it?)'</p>

<p>"[Both Hart and G. P. knew Rogers, who at that time had a
certain MS. book of G. P. in his possession. The book was
found after G. P.'s death and given to Rogers to be edited. G.
P. had promised during his lifetime that a particular disposition
should be made of this book after his death. This action ... was
here, and in subsequent utterances which from their private
nature I cannot quote, enjoined emphatically and repeatedly,
and had it been at once carried out, as desired by G. P., much
subsequent unhappiness and confusion might have been avoided.]</p>

<p>"During the latter part of the sitting, and without any relevance
to the remarks immediately before and after, which were
quite clear as expressions from G. P. came the words, 'Who's
James? Will&mdash;William.' [It must be remembered that Phinuit
was reporting G. P. throughout.] This was apparently explained
by Phinuit's further remarks at the close of the sitting.</p>

<p>"Phinuit: 'Who's Alice? (What do you want me to say to
her?) [To R. H.] Alice in spirit. Alice in spirit says it's all
over now and tell Alice in the body all is well. Tell Will I'll
explain things later on. He [George] calls Alice, too, in the
body. I want her to know me, too, Alice and Katharine....
He won't go till you say good-by. [The hand then wrote:
George Pelham. Good day (?) John.] ...'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"[Alice James, the sister of Professor William James, had
recently died in England. The first name of Mrs. James is also
Alice. Alice, the sister of Katharine, is the youngest daughter
of Mr. Howard and was very fond of G. P.]</p>

<p>"As I have already said, the most personal references made
at the sitting cannot be quoted; they were regarded by J. H. as
profoundly characteristic of Pelham.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was followed by the most remarkable experiences
of the kind that ever occurred before Hodgson himself
passed over to the majority and was ostensibly manifested
to his surviving friends through Mrs. Piper and other
mediums. G. P. sent for his friends the Howards (pseudonym)
with whom he had been a housemate in Boston, for
his parents, and for other friends. All of these came, very
skeptical regarding the genuineness of the manifestations,
but Mr. Howard&mdash;an eminent scholar of wide experience
of the world, became convinced that he was in converse
with the postcarnate intelligence of his old friend; the
majority of the relatives, who were of a more orthodox
habit than Mr. Howard, were brought at least to a condition
of agnosticism on the subject, and the arch-critic
Hodgson who had exposed more "spiritualistic" frauds
than all other men put together, was turned into a militant
spiritualist. G. P. was asked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"(Can't you tell us something he or your mother has done?)
'I saw her brush my clothes and put them away. I was by her
side as she did it. I saw her take my sleeve buttons from a
small box and give them to my father. I saw him send them to
John Hart. I saw her putting papers, etc., into a tin box.'</p>

<p>"The incident of the 'studs' was mentioned at the sitting of
Hart. G. P.'s clothes were brushed and put away, as Mrs.
Pelham wrote, not by herself, but by 'the man who had valeted
George.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This incident is used by Mrs. Sidgwick in Pr. XV, 31,
in support of the thesis that a medium's communications
are influenced by education and social habits. I am disposed
entirely to endorse this. The communications seem
to me to come from a blending of the control, the medium,
and the sitter. Perhaps this utterance will seem less
Delphic as we go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The following (Pr. XIII, 416f.) does not seem much
like telepathy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Piper [on coming out of the trance. Ed.]: 'There is
the man with the beard' [whom she saw in the trance. Ed.]
Mrs. Piper then described what she thought was a dream. 'I
saw a bright light and a face in it, a gentleman with a beard
on his face, and he had a very high forehead and he was writing.'
R. H.: 'Would you know it again if you saw it?' Mrs. Piper:
'Oh, yes. I would know it, I think.' R. H.: 'Well, try and recall
it....'</p>

<p>"After Mrs. Piper comes out of [a second. Ed.] trance she is
shown a collection of thirty-two photographs, nine of them being
of men, from which she selects the picture of the person whom she
saw when coming out of trance the first time. The photograph
that she first picked out was an excellent likeness of G. P. She
afterwards picked out another photograph of him. She stated
that she never knew the gentleman when living."</p></blockquote>

<p>Within twenty-four hours of this experience, or some
other reported elsewhere, the dream recollection had, like
dream recollections generally, faded away: she could not
recognize the photograph. We can talk about telopsis
here, if we want to, but telopsis of what? Of that photograph?
Nonsense! And as strange as anything else
about it, is that there is nothing strange about it. In my
own dreams I see any number of people I never saw before,
just as plainly as I see any number on the street, and if
photographs were handed me, as those were to Mrs. Piper,
immediately on awaking, I could identify them. This
identification is nothing out of the ordinary course of
nature, only the wit to see that it is, has but just come.</p>

<p>But with any sitter, Mrs. Piper <i>may</i> have had telepathically
just as definite an idea as the sitter has, or she
<i>may</i> always have been telepathically impressed in her
dream by the post-carnate man himself. Each one of us
will have to fumble to his own conviction, if he ever
reaches one.</p>

<p>Hodgson continues (Pr. XIII, 321-2):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was during this sitting [Dec. 22, 1892] that perhaps the
most dramatic incident of the whole series occurred....</p>

<p>"Mr. Howard: 'Tell me something that you and I alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
know, something in our past that you and I alone know.' G. P.:
'Do you doubt me, dear old fellow?' Mr. H.: 'I simply want
something&mdash;you have failed to answer certain questions that I
have asked&mdash;now I want you to give me the equivalent of the
answers to those questions in your own terms....' G. P.:
'You used to talk to me about....'</p>

<p>"The writing which followed ... contains too much of
the personal element in G. P.'s life to be reproduced here. Several
statements were read by me, and assented to by Mr.
Howard, and then was written 'private' and the hand gently
pushed me away. I retired to the other side of the room, and
Mr. Howard took my place close to the hand where he could
read the writing. He did not, of course, read it aloud, and it was
too private for my perusal. The hand, as it reached the end of
each sheet, tore it off from the block-book, and thrust it wildly at
Mr. Howard, and then continued writing. The circumstances
narrated, Mr. Howard informed me, contained precisely the
kind of test for which he had asked, and he said that he was 'perfectly
satisfied, perfectly.'</p>

<p>"Characteristic also of the living G. P. was the remark made
to me later, apparently with reference to the circumstances of
the private statements:</p>

<p>"'Thanks, Hodgson, for your kind help and reserved manners,
also patience in this difficult matter.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>All this, I suppose, is mere telepathy or the subliminal
self, or divided self, or some other self, of an average New
England housewife!</p>

<p>In this report the sittings take up some two hundred
pages, and Hodgson devoted about fifty pages to his reasons
for accepting the spiritistic hypothesis regarding
them. James said: "I know of no more masterly handling
anywhere of so unwieldy a mass of material"; and yet he
never squarely agreed with Hodgson, though he often
says he was tempted to.</p>

<p>Hodgson's reasons cannot be fairly understood without
familiarity with the evidence. They are very ingenious
and interesting, and would give the most skeptical reader
pause, but we have space for only a few generalizations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The manifestations of this G. P. communicating have not
been of a fitful and spasmodic nature, they have exhibited
the marks of a continuous living and persistent personality ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
what change has been discernible is a change not of any process
of disintegration, but rather of integration and evolution...."</p>

<p>"That G. P. could get into some closer relation with his
father and the Howards than with Miss M. or myself is intelligible;
but it is not so obvious why Mrs. Piper's <i>secondary personality</i>
should...."</p>

<p>"... The mixtures of truth and error bear no <i>discernible</i> relation
to the consciousness of the sitters, but suggest the action
of another intelligence groping confusedly among its own remembrances."</p>

<p>"We get all varieties of communication; some of them, purporting
to come from persons who when living were much mentally
disturbed, suggesting the incoherency of delirium; others of
them, purporting to come from persons who have been dead
very many years, suggesting a fainter dreaminess [or more remoteness.
Ed.]; others purporting to come from persons recently
deceased whose minds have been clear, showing a corresponding
clearness. My own conclusion ... is forced upon me
by experience, and strengthened by various statements of the
communicators themselves concerning the causes of confusion."</p>

<p>"Again, that persons just 'deceased' should be extremely confused
and unable to communicate directly, or even at all, seems
perfectly natural after the shock and wrench of death.</p>

<p>"Of such confusions as I have indicated above I cannot find
any satisfactory explanation in 'telepathy from the living,' but
they fall into a rational order when related to the personalities
of the 'dead.'"</p>

<p>"In cases where we should <i>a priori</i> be led to expect that the
communicators would certainly not be confused, or, if they were
confused, the confusion would not make much difference,
Phinuit was particularly successful. The cases I refer to are
those of little children recently deceased."</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to me a very strong point. Its force will be
realized by most of those who read the Sutton and Thaw
sittings in Pr. XIII. Phinuit, the "preposterous old
scoundrel," is eminently "the children's friend." Hodgson
continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Having tried the hypothesis of telepathy from the living for
several years, and the 'spirit' hypothesis also for several years,
I have no hesitation in affirming with the most absolute assurance
that the 'spirit' hypothesis is justified by its fruits, and the
other hypothesis is not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since Phinuit's 'departure' [explained below. Ed.] the voice
has been used on a few rare occasions only, and almost exclusively
by communicators who purported to be relatives of the sitters,
and who had used the voice before Phinuit's 'departure.' ...
But there never seemed to be any confusion between the personality
using the hand, whether this was 'clear' or not, and the
personality using the voice."</p></blockquote>

<p>This consideration and those before associated with it
seem to me more for the spiritistic hypothesis than any
others which we have met so far.</p>

<p>G. P. soon developed into the Mercury of the spiritistic
Pantheon, turned up at almost all sittings, went to seek
the friends of the sitters in the "spirit-world," and acted
as intermediary for those who were new to the conditions
of communication or had not enough of the psychokinetic
power which was alleged to be necessary to use them effectively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It should be noted that during G. P.'s life, telepathy
from the sitter had been reluctantly conceded as a defense
against the spiritistic hypothesis, but it was not till after
his death that teloteropathy from persons at a distance
had been conceded; and it was not until 1909&mdash;seven
years later, that James, one of the most steadfast holders
of the conservative fort, in his report on the communications
from Hodgson's alleged spirit, in Pr. XXIII, admitted,
as among the possible "sources other than R. H.'s
surviving spirit for the veridical communications from the
Hodgson control," "access to some cosmic reservoir, where
the memory of all mundane facts is stored and grouped
around personal centers of association."</p>

<p>James had a subtler mind than mine or almost anybody's.
Mine is not subtle enough to be very seriously
impressed by the difference between "memory of mundane
facts stored and grouped around personal centers of association,"
and a surviving personality; and what difference
does impress me, is pretty well filled up when the
"personal center" also has "grouped around" it, the initiative,
response, repartee and emotional and dramatic elements
that, as shown not only by the G. P. control, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
years later, by the Hodgson control, and by hundreds of
others, make a gallery of characters more vivid than those
depicted by all the historians. But even claiming them to
be historical, as in a sense they are, would not be claiming
them to be surviving. Many historical characters have put
in that claim through Mrs. Piper and other mediums, and
while our greatest psychologist knew as much as anybody
about the claims, and seemed somewhat on the road to admitting
them to be from surviving personalities, he did not
live to go farther than memories "stored and grouped
around personal centers of association."</p>

<p>But <i>à bas</i> the "memories"! one is tempted to say; credit
them all to telepathy if you will: what are they beside the
active and spontaneous emotions and responses?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meantime in 1892 our old acquaintance Stainton Moses
had "passed over," and in 1895 had ostensibly appeared
through Mrs. Piper to Professor Newbold of the University
of Pennsylvania, and Professor Newbold asked
him to bring his friends Imperator, Rector, etc. These
high-toned personages&mdash;none high-toneder, as John Hay
of blessed memory, puts it&mdash;nor more bombastic or long-winded,
had manifested before only through Moses (for
convenience I am using the simple phraseology that
would attend their genuineness, but do not mean to convey
any opinion), and when they came through Mrs.
Piper, they professed to find her in a very bad way because
of the "earth-bound" Phinuit, and they professed to remove
him to a higher sphere where he would be purified
and disinfected and sanctified and turned from a genial
sympathetic, humorous and, it must be admitted, occasionally
slangy and profane soul, into a prig of purest
ray serene. Rector now generally took his place with
Mrs. Piper, which he had done to some extent before.
The gang was very well satisfied with G. P., however,
and he appeared for some years as their valued friend and
collaborator, until in 1897 they declared his work done,
and his proper place a "higher sphere." He bade his
friends here affectionate farewells, but has occasionally
sent back messages, and has once or twice spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
himself. Mind, I am throughout speaking only provisionally;
but I would defy any writer to escape the verisimilitude,
and even if that were possible, it would involve intolerable
verbiage.</p>

<p>Imperator &amp; Co. now proposed to do most of the talking
themselves, and they did a frightful amount of it; and
occasionally really said something.</p>

<p>Moreover, they took charge of Mrs. Piper and Hodgson
too, in their goings and comings and all their ways, dictated
their diet and exercise, and even whom they should
have at sittings, giving the preference to people of exceptionally
high character, and to those in deep distress
from loss of friends, and eager to communicate with them.</p>

<p>The present writer and some others are tempted to
think that these autocratic personages are products telepathically
conveyed to Mrs. Piper from the unconscious
imagination of Hodgson and his recollection of Moses'
writings, with perhaps a little involuntary dash of Prof.
Newbold. But if they are, the imagination is expanded
to a degree entirely outside of ordinary experience, and
its study must enlarge our conception of the range of
human faculty. Whatever they were, if only an allegorized
form of faith cure, there is no question about their
beneficial effect on the clearness of the sittings, and on the
health and happiness of Mrs. Piper and Hodgson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>James says something which goes to the root of the
whole business, and which, though it is episodic to the
Hodgson narrative, may as well be considered here (Pr.
XXIII, 3):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dr. Hodgson was disposed to admit the claim to reality of
Rector and of the whole Imperator-Band, ... while I have
rather favored the idea of their all being dream-creations of
Mrs. Piper.... I can see no contradiction between Rector's
being on the one hand an improvised creature of this sort,
and his being on the other hand the extraordinarily impressive
personality which he unquestionably is.... Critical and
fastidious sitters have recognized his wisdom, and confess their
debt to him as a moral adviser. With all due respect to Mrs.
Piper, I feel very sure that her own waking capacity for being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a spiritual adviser, if it were compared with Rector's, would fall
greatly behind."</p></blockquote>

<p>"With all due respect" for Professor James's opinion, I
think I do "see [a] contradiction," and I see the contradiction
because, with Professor James, "I feel very sure that
her own waking capacity for being a spiritual adviser, if
it were compared with Rector's, would fall greatly behind."
If the Imperator band were merely, as James suggests,
"dream creations," ... and if "her own waking capacity
... compared with Rector's, would fall greatly behind,"
how could she make anything so superior to herself?
How can she do better as Rector than she can as
herself? The whole scheme seems to me akin to the Du-Prel
and Myers scheme of making a man lift himself higher
than his head by his own boot-straps; and beside it the
spiritistic hypothesis seems simplicity and probability
themselves.</p>

<p>The simplest individual, incarnate (or discarnate?), of
course manifests <i>himself</i> in a way that the most skillful
dramatist could not equal, and it may well be questioned
whether it is not more rational to assume that the hundreds
of alleged personalities dramatized in the words and gestures
of Mrs. Piper are manifestations by the personalities
themselves, than that they are creations of some as yet
unknown kind of genius residing in some layer of Mrs.
Piper's consciousness, and getting its material from fragments
among her own memories or by telepathy from those
of other living persons, present or remote.</p>

<p>Hodgson closes his report (Pr. XIII, 409):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has been stated repeatedly that the 'channel is not yet
clear,' that the machine is still in process of repair; and it has
been prophesied that I shall myself return eventually to America
and spend several years further in the investigation of Mrs.
Piper's trance, and that more remarkable evidence of identity
will be given than any heretofore obtained."</p></blockquote>

<p>He did return and continue his beloved work for several
years. But the next time we meet him it will be as an
alleged denizen of the spirit world, and perhaps his testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in that capacity was part of the "more remarkable
evidence of identity" promised.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These influences, whatever their fundamental character,
having made a saint of Hodgson, as was alleged by a
friend who did not believe that the influences were from a
post-carnate world, the drama took a new turn on December
20, 1905, in the death which Hodgson had eagerly
awaited, and his ostensible reappearances through Mrs.
Piper and other mediums. The principal report of them
is made by his friends Professor William James, Mrs.
Henry Sidgwick, Mr. J. G. Piddington and Sir Oliver
Lodge in Pr. XXIII, and occupies some 170 octavo pages,
most of them literal reports of sittings. Other manifestations
appear in the heteromatic writing of Mrs. Holland
(Pr. XX) and elsewhere. Of course but a few entirely
inadequate scraps can be given here.</p>

<p>As in the case of G. P., the first appearance did not take
place until, on Dec. 28th, a peculiarly close and congenial
friend of Hodgson happened to have a sitting&mdash;an argument
of course for telepathy from the friend, but an equal
argument for a genuine communication that had to await
a congenial sitter.</p>

<p>To avoid constant circumlocution, I will provisionally
write as if Hodgson were really speaking. Indeed, I doubt
if I could persistently do otherwise: for the utterances are
so natural that all the editors of the Pr. S. P. R. unconsciously
fall into that way of expression.</p>

<p>James says (Pr. XXIII, 7) that the first alleged appearance
of Hodgson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"was at Miss Theodate Pope's sitting on Dec. 28th, 1905 [the
eighth day after Hodgson's death. Ed.] ... Rector had
been writing, when the hand dropped the pencil and worked convulsively
several seconds in a very excited manner.</p>

<p>"Miss P.: 'What is the matter?' [The hand, shaking with
apparently great excitement, wrote the letter H, ... bearing
down so hard on the paper that the point of the pencil was
broken. It then wrote 'Hodgson.']</p></blockquote>

<p>Was all this a "put-up job?" And if so, who put it up,
and why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Miss P.: 'God bless you!' [The hand writes 'I am'&mdash;followed
by rapid scrawls, as if regulator of machine were out of
order.] Miss P.: 'Is this my friend?' [Hand assents by knocking
five times on paper-pad.] (Rector): 'Peace, friends, he is
here, it was he, but he could not remain, he was so choked. He
is doing all in his power to return.... Better wait for a
few moments until he breathes freer again.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Do spirits require a supply of oxygen, or is the expression
metaphorical for something not accurately communicable
to our intelligence? It occurs several times. Frequently
the "spirits" say they are tired, especially in the
transition from the body. The expression "choked" may
be purely metaphorical, yet it hardly reinforces the argument
for spiritism.</p>

<p>James says (Pr. XXIII, 13f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The R. H. control suddenly wrote: 'Give ring to Margaret
back to Margaret.' [Mrs. Lyman's name [pseudonym. Ed.]
is not Margaret.] Miss P.: 'Who is Margaret?' R. H.: 'I was
with her in summer.' Miss P.: 'All right, but the ring has not
been found yet. Can you find out where it is?' R. H.: 'The
undertaker got it....'"</p>

<p>"On January 24th, Mrs. Lyman had her first sitting. As soon
as Hodgson appeared he wrote: 'The ring. You gave it me on
my fiftieth birthday. When they asked I didn't want to say
you gave it me.... Two palm-leaves joining each other&mdash;Greek.
[Here followed an illegible word. The palms truly described
the ring, which Mrs. Piper probably had seen; but it
bore no Greek inscription....]' Mrs. L.: 'Yes, Dick, where
is it now?' R. H.: '... They took it off my finger after I
was gone.' Mrs. L.: 'No, they didn't find it on your finger.'
R. H.: 'Pocket, it was in my pocket. I'll find it, you shall
have it.'</p>

<p>"On January 29th, Mrs. L. had another sitting. The Hodgson
control wrote: 'I have been trying to make clear about that
ring. It is on my mind all the time. I thought if I could get
Margaret B. to get it for me, I would get it to you through her,
then no one would understand. I could not tell Miss Pope about
you.' [Then a possible attempt to draw a symbol engraved on
the ring.] 'No one living knows this but myself and yourself.'
[Note the term 'living' as applied to himself. Ed.] Mrs. L.:
'That is true, but what was the motto in the ring?' R. H.: 'All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
will be clear to me in time. Do not ask me test questions
now....'"</p></blockquote>

<p>His failure to remember it is one of the most knock-down
anti-evidential arguments, but it is equally anti-telepathic.
His never speaking of the ring to other friends, the
Jameses, and Mr. Dorr, seems very evidential.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hodgson (or the control, if you prefer, whatever that
may mean), kept worrying about the ring through several
sittings, and got so far as to imagine that he had seen it on
the finger of a man who stole it. It was eventually found
in Hodgson's waistcoat pocket. James comments on the
case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole incident lends itself easily to a naturalistic interpretation.
Mrs. Piper or her trance-consciousness may possibly
have suspected the source of the ring. Mrs. Lyman's manner
may have confirmed the suspicion. The manner in which the
first misleading reference to 'Margaret' was afterwards explained
away may well have been the cunning of a 'control'
trying plausibly to cover his tracks and justify his professed
identity."</p></blockquote>

<p>But, please, what is a "control"? And why does one
want to be taken for somebody else? Is this explanation
"naturalistic"? It seems to my poor wits to grant the
whole case, and reminds me of the deniers of telepathy
availing themselves of it to explain away spiritism. Or
does James mean a control faked by Mrs. Piper? If he
had not already grown past that, he gave indications that
he had later. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The description of the house and of the man to whom he
ascribes its [the ring's. Ed.] present possession sounds like vague
groping, characteristic also of control-cunning."</p></blockquote>

<p>But why should there be "control-cunning"? Is it
anything like commentator-cunning?</p>

<p>James proceeds without any "cunning:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the other hand, if the hypothesis be seriously entertained
that Hodgson's spirit was there in a confused state, using the
permanent Piper automatic machinery to communicate through,
the whole record is not only plausible but natural. It presents
just that mixture of truth and groping which we ought to expect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Hodgson has the ring 'on his mind' just as Mrs. Lyman has.
Like her, he wishes its source not to be bruited abroad. He describes
it accurately enough, truly tells of his taking it to the
fatal boat-club [He died while playing hand-ball there. Ed.],
and of putting it into his waistcoat-pocket there, of the waistcoat
being taken from the locker, and vaguely, but not quite
erroneously, indicates its present position."</p></blockquote>

<p>And why should it not be even "<i>quite</i> erroneously"?
Nearly all the reasoning I have seen on these matters is
vitiated by the entirely gratuitous traditional assumption
that if a soul survives death, it enters at once into measureless
wisdom. Hodgson (?) and the rest seem pretty much
the same sort of people that they were here, and I for one
am glad of it.</p>

<p>In the sittings of many others of Hodgson's friends the
control showed a similar abundant knowledge of their experiences
with Hodgson living, and, most important of all,
it seems to me, all of Hodgson's exceptionally marked
habits of thought and expression. We have room for but
little more. James says (Pr. XXIII, 36):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hodgson was distinguished during life by great animal
spirits. He was fond of argument, chaff, and repartee, a good
deal of a gesticulator, and a great laugher.... Chaff and
slang from a spirit have an undignified sound for the reader, but
to the interlocutors of the R. H. control they seem invariably
to have been elements of verisimilitude."</p></blockquote>

<p>God save me from a heaven where there is no "chaff and
slang"! I should fail to recognize some of my best friends
among the loftiest souls who have escaped the flesh, Hodgson
not the least. However intense the interest heretofore
taken in a future world, I doubt if it has ever been
thoroughly healthy, or ever will be before we get our
conceptions of that world off stilts. James continues
(pp. 37-8):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This, however, did not exclude very serious talk with the
same persons&mdash;quite the reverse sometimes, as when one sitter
of this class notes: 'Then came words of kindness which were
too intimate and personal to be recorded, but which left me so
deeply moved that shortly afterwards, at the sitting's close, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
fainted dead away&mdash;it had seemed as though he had in all
reality been there and speaking to me.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>If James ran any one of his virtues into the ground,
perhaps it was his modesty concerning anything connected
with himself. Instance the following introduction and
what it introduces:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>W. J.'s Sitting.</i> (May 21st, 1906). (Pr. XXIII, 8of.)</p>

<p>"[J.] The evidence is so much the same sort of thing throughout,
and makes such insipid reading, that I hesitate to print
more of it in full. But I know that many critics insist on having
the largest possible amount of <i>verbatim</i> material on which to base
their conclusions, so I select a specimen of the R. H. control's
utterances when he was less 'strong.' The reader, I fear, will
find it long and tedious, but he can skip.</p>

<p>"(R. H. enters, saying:) 'Well, well, well, well! Well, well,
well, that is&mdash;here I am. Good morning, good morning,
Alice.' Mrs. W. J.:'Good morning, Mr. Hodgson.' R. H.: 'I
am right here. Well, well, well! I am delighted!' W. J.:
'Hurrah! R. H.! Give us your hand!' R. H.: 'Hurrah, William!
God bless you. How are you?' W. J.: 'First rate.'
R. H.: 'Well, I am delighted to see you. Well, have you solved
those problems yet?' W. J.: 'Which problems do you refer to?'
R. H.: 'Did you get my messages?' W. J.: 'I got some messages
about your going to convert me.' ... [R. H. had already
sent me, through other sitters, messages about my little faith.
W. J.] W. J.: 'Yes.' R. H.: 'Well, it has amounted to this,&mdash;that
I have learned by experience that there is more truth than
error in what I have been studying.' W. J.: 'Good!' R. H.:
'I am so delighted to see you to-day that words fail me.' W. J.:
'Well, Hodgson, take your time and don't be nervous.' R. H.:
'No. Well, I think I could ask the same of you! Well, now, tell
me,&mdash;I am very much interested in what is going on in the
society, and Myers and I are also interested in the society over
here. You understand that we have to have a medium on this
side, while you have a medium on your side, and through the
two we communicate with you.' ... W. J.: 'You don't mean
Rector?' R. H.: 'No, not at all. It is&mdash;&mdash;do you remember a
medium whom we called Prudens?' 'Yes.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>From one point of view, his not naming G. P. or Rector
gives food for skepticism. But why didn't Mrs. Piper
do the job consistently, if it was she who did it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"R. H.: 'What I want to know first of all is about the society.
I am sorry that it could not go on.' W. J.: 'There was nobody
to take your place....' R. H.: 'William, can't you see, don't you
understand, and don't you remember how I used to walk up and
down before that open fireplace trying to convince you of my
experiments?' W. J.: 'Certainly, certainly.' R. H.: 'And you
would stand with your hands in your trousers pockets. You got
very impatient with me sometimes, and you would wonder if I
was correct. I think you are very skeptical.' W. J.: 'Since you
have been returning I am much more near to feeling as you felt
than ever before.' R. H.: 'Good! Well, that is capital.' W. J.:
'Your "personality" is beginning to make me feel as you felt.'
R. H.: 'If you can give up to it, William, and feel the influence
of it and the reality of it, it will take away the sting of
death.... Now tell me a little bit more about the Society.
That will help me keep my thoughts clear. I think, William&mdash;are
you standing?' W. J.: 'Yes, I am standing.' R. H.: 'Well,
can't you sit?' W. J.: 'Yes.' R. H.: 'Well, sit. Let's have a
nice talk.'..."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing "evidential" about the last couple of
lines in the scientific sense, but there are several kinds of
sense. James continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(Pr. XXIII, 109): "The following incident belongs to my
wife's and Miss Putnam's sitting of June 12th, 1906:&mdash;Mrs. J.
said: 'Do you remember what happened in our library one night
when you were arguing with Margie [Mrs. J.'s sister]?'&mdash;'I
had hardly said "remember,"' she notes, 'in asking this question,
when the medium's arm was stretched out and the fist
shaken threateningly,' then these words came:</p>

<p>"R. H.: 'Yes, I did this in her face. I couldn't help it. She
was so impossible to move. It was wrong of me, but I couldn't
help it.' [I myself well remember this fist-shaking incident, and
how we others laughed over it after Hodgson had taken his
leave. What had made him so angry was my sister-in-law's defense
of some slate-writing she had seen in California.&mdash;W. J.]"</p>

<p>(Pr. XXIII, 112): "On Jan. 30, 1906, Mrs. M. had a sitting.
Mrs. M. said:</p>

<p>"'Do you remember our last talk together, at N., and how,
in coming home we talked about the work?' (R. H.): 'Yes,
yes.' Mrs. M.: 'And I said if we had a hundred thousand dollars&mdash;'R.
H.: 'Buying Billy!!' Mrs. M.: 'Yes, Dick, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was it&mdash;"buying Billy."' R. H.: 'Buying only Billy?' Mrs.
M.: 'Oh no&mdash;I wanted Schiller too. How well you remember!'</p>

<p>"Mrs. M., before R. H.'s death, had had dreams of extending
the American Branch's operations by getting an endowment,
and possibly inducing Prof. Newbold (Billy) and Dr. Schiller to
co-operate in work.</p></blockquote>

<p>This buying Billy and Schiller brought Podmore
squarely around, for the first time, I think, from his
previous life-long fight against telepathy. He says (<i>Newer
Spiritualism</i>, p. 222):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is impossible to doubt that we have here proof of a supernormal
agency of some kind&mdash;either telepathy by the trance intelligence
from the sitter or some kind of communication with
the dead."</p></blockquote>

<p>Two pages farther on, however, appears the <i>advocatus
diaboli</i> (<i>Op. Cit.</i>, p. 224):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When asked to give the contents of any sealed letters written
in his life-time for the express purpose of being read by him after
death the two sentences were given: 'There is no death' and
'out of life into life eternal' (p. 102). Whatever Hodgson may
have written, it was surely not quite so commonplace as that."</p></blockquote>

<p>To my gullible apprehension, it seems eminently appropriate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the interesting phenomena investigated by the
S. P. R., have been the automatic, or I should prefer to
say heteromatic, writing of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland,
which were not made in trance. Vol. XX of the Proceedings
is entirely given up to the consideration of it by Mrs.
Verrall. She is the wife of a professor in Cambridge, and
herself lecturer in Newnham College. The phenomena
themselves are of moderate interest beside most of those
described in these pages, but their evidential value is high,
and their implications most important, and the treatment
of them is pervaded by wide scholarship, and is charming.
The experiences, however, do not connect with the main
Moses&mdash;Piper&mdash;G. P.&mdash;Hodgson&mdash;Myers thread on which these
brief extracts have naturally strung themselves, and I will
not attenuate that thread to make room for this outside
strand. I especially commend Mrs. Verrall's volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
however, to anybody who combines with an interest in
Psychical Research, an interest in really "elegant letters."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following scrap relating to Hodgson is from an account
by Miss Johnson (Research officer of the S. P. R.) of
Mrs. Holland (pseudonym) (Pr. XXI, 303f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In February, 1905 ... Mrs. Holland found that the
automatic writing was beginning to make her feel faint or sleepy.
The condition was obviated at the time.... It now began
to recur. [This sort of thing is noted in several places as preceding
the advent of a new, and especially a strong control. Ed.]</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holland learned of Hodgson's death on January 2, 1906.
Her script on Friday, February 9, 1906, 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span>, is as follows (Pr.
XXI, 304):</p>

<p>"... S j d i b s e I p e h t p o&mdash;Only one letter further
on&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<p>"They are not haphazard figures read them as letters&mdash;....</p>

<p>"K. 57. [a Christian name]&mdash;Gray paper&mdash;</p>

<p>"I found that in spite of the rather obvious hints....&mdash;'Only
one letter further on' and 'Not haphazard figures read
them as letters,'&mdash;Mrs. Holland had not deciphered the initial
conundrums. The first letters are formed from the name 'Richard
Hodgson' by substituting for each letter of the name the
letter following it in the alphabet; the numbers represent the
same name by substituting for each letter the number of its
place in the alphabet.</p>

<p>"I asked Mrs. Holland if she had ever played at conundrums
of this kind. She told me that as a child in the nursery she had
played at a 'secret language' made by using either the letter
before or the letter after the real one. But she had never practised
or thought of using numbers in this way. She noted afterwards:
'When my hand wrote them I thought they were an
addition sum and hoped [my subliminal] would add it very correctly
and quickly. [My supraliminal] is <i>very</i> poor at figures.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Hodgson in life was very fond of these puzzles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>All this anticipates a scrap of explanation out of a much
longer and more interesting manifestation. Mrs. Holland
wrote to Miss Johnson (Pr. XXI, 171f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Any automatic writing that comes to me is nearly always in
verse, headed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Believe in what thou canst not see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the vision come to thee.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The verses, though often childishly simple in wording and
jingling in rhyme, are rarely trivial in subject. I once wrote
down fourteen poems in little over an hour.... When I
write original verse I do so slowly and carefully, with frequent
erasures: automatic verse is always as if swiftly dictated and
there are never any erasures. I am always fully conscious, but
my hand moves so rapidly that I seldom know what words it is
forming.</p>

<p>"... I copy one set of verses.... I wrote it down as
quickly as it was possible for my hand to move, and was surprised
afterwards to find that it had a definite form of its own.
It is exactly as it came to me, not 'polished' or altered in the
least.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I whom he loved, am a ghost,<br /></span>

<p>Two stanzas are omitted from lack of space.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>"... Automatic verses do not deal much with facts, but
once when I was staying in Italy, in an old palazzo I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
before seen, the day after my arrival, and before I had been into
the garden, the impulse to write came on me, and I yielded to it,
without however ceasing to take part in the conversation of two
friends who were with me. One of them, who knew about my
automatic writing, asked me to read what had come to me. I
did so:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Under the orange tree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who is it lies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baby hair that is flaxen fair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the dead leaves be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Look at the dead child's eyes!'<span style="margin-left:3em;">(1901)</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'This is very curious,' said my friend, 'there is a tradition
that a child is buried in the garden here, but I know you have
never heard it.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>These heteromatic poems appear to be but extreme illustrations
of the "inspiration" that poets have generally
claimed for themselves. The author's modest deprecations
seem to me unjust to her own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Holland continues (p. 173f.):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have said that automatic verses do not deal much with
facts, but once, when I was sensitive after illness, I experienced
a new form of automatic writing, in the shape of letters which
my hand insisted on writing to a newly-made acquaintance.</p>

<p>"The first of these letters began with a pet name I did not
know, and was signed with the full name of someone I had never
heard of, and who I afterwards learnt had been dead some years.
It was clearly impressed upon me for whom the letter was intended,
but thinking it due to some unhealthy fancy of my own,
I destroyed it. Having done so I was punished by an agonizing
headache, and the letter was repeated, till in self-defense I sent
it and the succeeding ones to their destination."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is perhaps the most "evidential" thing I know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been natural to follow the career of Hodgson both
incarnate and alleged post-carnate, without interrupting
for the post-carnate career of Myers who had died in 1901,
four years before Hodgson. Myers was perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
leading English spirit in the S. P. R., and everybody interested
in Psychical Research&mdash;the skeptical as well as
the credulous&mdash;was looking with great interest for manifestations
professing to come from that spirit in a post-carnate
state. As usual, they are a terrible jumble. Myers
was not a demonstrative person. He had not, like
Hodgson, salient characteristics of manner or expression.
In that respect the communicating personality resembles
him. His absorbing interests were the S. P. R., poetry,
and classical literature. In those respects, too, the personality
resembles him.</p>

<p>Mr. George Dorr of Boston got from the Myers control,
through Mrs. Piper, a large mass of classical lore which
Mr. Dorr asserts he never could have possessed himself,
and which certainly Mrs. Piper never did (Pr. XXIV).</p>

<p>Myers' appearances, though of great interest to students,
do not make as good general reading as G. P.'s and
Hodgson's, and we will make space for only one.</p>

<p>On September 16, 1903, nearly three years after Myers'
death and his first alleged appearance through Mrs.
Thompson, there was apparently the first appearance of a
Myers control through Mrs. Holland. Myers, as his control
intimates later, wrote, like Hodgson, for evidential
purposes in cryptic ways that the heteromatist probably
never would have deliberately used. The writing was,
says Miss Johnson (Pr. XXI, 178):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On two sides of a half-sheet of paper; the first side begins
with the initial 'F.,' and the second ends with the initial 'M.';
the whole passage is divided into four short sections, the first
three ending respectively in '17/,' '/1' and '/01.' January 17th,
1901, was the date of Mr. Myers's death, mentioned in <i>Human
Personality</i>; but the simple device of separating these initials
and items from one another was completely effective in its apparent
object. I read the passage a good many times before
I saw what they meant and I found that the meaning had entirely
escaped Mrs. Holland's notice."</p></blockquote>

<p>This refers to the script containing the notorious stanza
(Pr. XXI, 192) which excited the derision of the Philistine
world of both continents, and disturbed not a small portion
of the enlightened world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">I yearn to you and cannot write."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why the stanza excited so much adverse comment I
cannot clearly make out: for what is it but a demonstration
of what it claims, "I ... cannot write," unless it
be also a demonstration that the tired shade, or befogged
subliminal, or impotent group of world-soul elements, or
what you please, could not criticise either?</p>

<p>It is worth remarking, by the way, that the Myers control,
despite this and some other complaints of inefficiency,
generally professed, as do the controls generally,
to be in a condition of great happiness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A word should be said of the very instructive and tedious
subject of Cross-Correspondence, which has lately attracted
more attention from the S. P. R. than any other
topic.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Verrall in London and Mrs. Holland in India
both, at about the same time, write heteromatically about
a subject that they both understand, that is probably coincidence;
but if both write about it when but one of them
understands it, that is probably teloteropathy; and if both
write about it when neither understands it, and each of
their respective writings is apparently nonsense, but both
make sense when put together, the only obvious hypothesis
is that both were inspired by a third mind. The term
Cross-Correspondence has been reserved for such a phenomenon.
There are many famous ones&mdash;famous in a
small circle, if that's not too Hibernian. The subject is
entirely too complex for any treatment in our space. The
reader is referred to Pr. XVIII, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIV
and XXV.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The critics generally agree upon two points as the strongest
against the spiritistic hypothesis. They were not
enough for Myers, Hodgson and Sir Oliver Lodge, but
they were strongest in suspending the judgment of James,
Newbold and others of eminence.</p>

<p>The first is that Myers and Miss Wilde, of Holyoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Mass., left sealed letters, the contents of which they purposed
to announce should they be able to do so in a post-carnate
life. The words ostensibly given by them through
Mrs. Piper bore no relation to those found in the envelopes.
Apologists offer in explanation that the memories are much
confused by death, and means of communication at best
very poor. There are many other cases where there is no
apparent need of such apology: that there should be need
of it in perhaps the most crucial cases of all, is itself suspicious.
Farther, the apologists say that while it is well,
and may be in the System of Things, that we should have
enough communication with the world beyond to give
souls aspiring that way, hope enough to keep their aspirations
alive, it would not be well, and apparently is not
in the System of Things, that we should have such certainty
as to interfere with our living our lives here "for
all we are worth"; and in support of this contention are
cited the useless and worse than useless lives that, in
spite of many cases far to the contrary, have been led in
direct consequence of assumed certainty of a future life.</p>

<p>Hodgson was supposed to have left some sealed letters
with intentions like those of Myers and Miss Wilde, but no
such letters have been found. His control, however, gave
some sentences alleged to be in them which are quoted
some pages back.</p>

<p>The other hard nut in the S. P. R. records which resists
the spiritistic hypothesis, is that Moses living told Myers
that the Imperator gang gave certain well known names as
borne by them on earth, and that Moses post-carnate (?)
gave Professor Newbold an entirely different set of names
for the same individualities. Of course the apologies for
the envelope failures can be tried on this case, whether
they fit it or not. And there is also the ampler, though
perhaps less adequate one, that the whole Imperator business
looks like a complex telepathic freak of the imaginations
of Moses, Mrs. Piper, Professor Newbold, Hodgson
and God knows how many others.</p>

<p>But a proof that the spiritistic hypothesis will not fit
these cases, is no proof that it will not fit the cases of
G. P., Hodgson, Gurney, Myers and hosts of others who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
were known to the witnesses, and whose post-carnate manifestations
tally with their incarnate ones, and yet with
occasional and, so far, unexplainable lapses and inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best opinion of the investigators who have
not reached the faith of Myers, Hodgson and Lodge, is that
while failure of the sealed letters, and the Moses inconsistencies,
are unanswerable on the negative side, there
are other circumstances equally unanswerable on the positive
side&mdash;especially the cumulative weight of the evidence,
and the dramatic renderings which apparently
would be impossible from any source but the characters
themselves; that the contradictions or paradoxes are
merely like many others in the borderland of our knowledge:
for instance, that between free will and determinism;
and that the only rational attitude is a suspense of opinion
until more evidence accumulates. This was the attitude
of James, who served a term as President of the S. P. R.,
and contributed voluminously to its Proceedings.</p>

<p>But, however we may interpret the phenomena, or if
we do not interpret them at all, we cannot shut our eyes
to the fact that they point to modes of Force and reaches
of Mind vastly wider than before suspected, and promising
well to repay farther investigation. To some they may
also suggest a recovery from the scrap-heap of abandoned
things, and an appropriation to new uses, of that sadly
battered and misapplied old virtue known as Faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now we will give the attitude of the latest of James'
successors, so far as it can be conveyed by a few extracts
from the inaugural address of Professor Bergson.</p>

<p>As to his estimate of the labors of the Society: in
thanking them for the honor of his election, he said (Pr.,
Part LXVII, Vol. XXVI, 462-3):</p>

<p>Je ne connais que par des lectures les phénomènes dont
la Société s'occupe; je n'ai rien vu, rien observé moi-même.
Comment alors avez-vous pu venir me prendre, pour me
faire succéder aux grands savants, aux penseurs éminents
qui ont occupé tour à tour le fauteuil présidentiel.... Si
j'osais plaisanter sur un pareil sujet, je dirais qu'il y a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
eu ici un effet de télépathie ou de clairvoyance, que vous
avez senti de loin l'intérêt que je prenais à vos recherches,
et que vous m'avez aperçu, à travers les quatre cents
kilomètres qui nous séparaient, lisant attentivement vos
comptes-rendus, suivant vos travaux avec une ardente
curiosité. Ce que vous avez dépensé d'ingéniosité, de
pénétration, de patience, de ténacité, à l'exploration de
la <i>terra incognita</i> des phénomènes psychiques me paraît
en effet admirable. Mais, plus encore ... j'admire le
courage qu'il vous a fallu pendant les <i>premières</i> années
surtout, pour lutter contre les préventions d'une bonne
partie du monde savant et pour braver la raillerie, qui fait
peur aux plus intrépides. C'est pourquoi je suis fier&mdash;plus
fier que je ne saurais le dire&mdash;d'avoir été élu président de
la Société de recherche psychique. J'ai lu quelque part
l'histoire d'un officier subalterne que les hasards de la
bataille, la disparition de ses chefs tués ou blessés, avaient
appelé à l'honneur de commander le régiment: toute sa
vie il y pensa, toute sa vie il en parla, et du souvenir de ces
quelques heures son existence entière restait imprégnée.
Je suis cet officier subalterne, et toujours je me féliciterai
de la chance inattendue qui m'aura mis&mdash;non pas pour
quelques heures, mais pour quelques mois&mdash;à la tête d'un
régiment de braves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He accounted for the indifference long shown by men of
science to the phenomena studied by the S. P. R. by the
fact that they do not square with the widely accepted
theory of parallelism between mental action and brain
function. This is of course especially the case with phenomena
indicating the mind's survival of the body. He
then proceeded to dispose of the doctrine of parallelism
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, 470-75):</p>

<p>Bref, l'hypothèse d'un <i>parallélisme</i> rigoureux entre le
cérébral et le mental paraît éminemment scientifique.
D'instinct, la philosophie et la science tendent à écarter ce
qui contredirait cette hypothèse ou ce qui serait mal compatible
avec elle. Et tel paraît être, à première vue, le cas
des faits qui relèvent de la "recherche psychique,"&mdash;ou
tout au moins le cas de bon nombre d'entre eux....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Pour une seule fonction de la pensée, en effet, l'expérience
a pu faire croire qu'elle était localisée en un certain
point du cerveau: je veux parler de la mémoire, et plus
particulièrement de la mémoire des mots. Ni pour le
jugement, ni pour le raisonnement, ni pour aucune autre
faculté de la pensée proprement dite nous n'avons la moindre
raison de supposer qu'elle soit attachée à tels ou tels
processus cérébraux déterminés.... Si l'on examine de
près tous les faits allégués en faveur d'une exacte correspondance
et d'une espèce <i>d'adhérence</i> de la vie mentale à
la vie cérébrale (je laisse de côté, cela va sans dire, les
sensations et les mouvements, car le cerveau est certainement
un organe sensori moteur), on voit que ces faits se
réduisent aux phénomènes de mémoire, et que c'est la
localisation des aphasies, et cette localisation seule, qui
semble apporter à la doctrine paralléliste un commencement
de preuve expérimentale.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He says that lesions in the place in the brain already alluded
to</p>

<p>"rendent, en réalité, impossible ou difficile <i>l'évocation</i>
des souvenirs; elles portent sur le mécanisme du rappel,
et sur ce mécanisme seulement. Plus précisément, le rôle
du cerveau est ici de faire que l'esprit, quand il a besoin de
tel ou tel souvenir, puisse obtenir du corps une certaine attitude
ou certains mouvements naissants, qui présentent au
souvenir cherché un cadre approprié. Si le cadre est là, le
souvenir viendra, de lui-même, s'y insérer. L'organe cérébral
prépare le cadre, il ne fournit pas le souvenir....
Dans le travail de la pensée en général, comme dans
l'opération de la mémoire, le cerveau nous apparaît comme
chargé d'imprimer au corps les mouvements et les attitudes
qui <i>jouent</i> ce que l'esprit <i>pense</i> ou ce que les circonstances
l'invitent â penser.... Il en connaîtrait tout juste ce
qui est exprimable en gestes, attitudes et mouvements
du corps, ce que l'état d'âme contient d'action en voie
d'accomplissement, ou simplement naissante: le reste lui
échapperait.... Les phénomènes cérébraux sont en effet
à la vie mentale ce que les gestes du chef d'orchestre
sont à la symphonie: ils en dessinent les articulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
motrices, ils ne font pas autre chose. On ne trouverait
donc rien des opérations de l'esprit proprement dit à l'intérieur
du cerveau....</p>

<p>Orienter notre pensée vers l'action, l'amener à préparer
l'acte que les circonstances réclament, voilâ ce pour quoi
notre cerveau est fait...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then he turns to the strange memories of the dream
state, in ordinary sleep, hypnosis and trance:</p>

<p>Bien des faits semblent indiquer que le passé se conserve
jusque dans ses moindres détails et qu'il n'y a pas d'oubli
réel. Vous vous rappelez ce qu'on raconte des noyés et
des pendus qui, revenus à la vie, déclarent avoir eu, en
quelques secondes, la vision panoramique de la totalité de
leur vie passée....</p>

<p>Mais ce que je dis de la mémoire serait aussi vrai de
la perception. Je ne puis entrer ici dans le détail d'une
démonstration que j'ai faite autrefois: qu'il me suffise de
rappeler que tout devient obscur, et même incompréhensible,
si l'on considère les centres cérébraux comme des
organes capables de transformer en états conscients des
ébranlements matériels, que tout s'éclaircit au contraire
si l'on voit simplement dans ces centres (et dans les dispositifs
sensoriels auxquels ils sont liés) des instruments de
sélection chargés de choisir, dans le champ immense de
nos perceptions virtuelles, celles qui devront s'actualiser.... J'estime
que nous percevons virtuellement beaucoup
plus de choses que nous n'en percevons actuellement,
et qu'ici encore le rôle de notre corps est d'écarter du
champ de notre conscience tout ce qui ne nous serait d'aucun
intérêt pratique, tout ce qui ne se prête pas à notre
action.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This implies what is more fully stated elsewhere in
M. Bergson's works, and suggested by nearly all the philosophers,
that mind pervades the universe, and flows
through each organism, according to its constitution, as
force and matter do.</p>

<p>He does not go into the paradox (perhaps another of
those we have already alluded to) of individuality surviving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
as part of the universal mind, but contents himself
with saying merely:</p>

<p>Mais si les faits, étudiés sans parti pris, nous amènent
au contraire à considérer la vie mentale comme beaucoup
plus vaste que la vie cérébrale, la survivance devient si
probable que l'obligation de la preuve incombera à celui
qui la nie, bien plutôt qu'à celui qui l'affirme; car, ainsi
que je le disais ailleurs, "l'unique raison que nous puissions
avoir de croire à une extinction de la conscience après
la mort est que nous voyons le corps se désorganiser, et
cette raison n'a plus de valeur si l'indépendance <i>au moins</i>
partielle de la conscience à l'égard du corps est, elle aussi,
un fait d'expérience."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Regarding telepathy, he made the following suggestions
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, 465, 466, 475-6):</p>

<p>Si la télépathie est un fait réel, c'est un fait susceptible
de se répéter indéfiniment. Je vais plus loin: si la télépathie
est un fait réel, il est fort possible qu'elle opère à
chaque instant et chez tout le monde, mais avec trop peu
d'intensité pour se faire remarquer, ou en présence d'obstacles
qui neutralisent l'effet au moment même où il va
se manifester. Nous produisons de l'électricité à tout
moment, l'atmosphère est constamment électrisée, nous
circulons parmi des courants magnétiques; et pourtant des
millions d'hommes ont vécu pendant des milliers d'années
sans soupçonner l'existence de l'électricité. Il pourrait en
être de même de la télépathie. Mais peu importe. Un
point est en tous cas incontestable, c'est que, si la télépathie
est réelle, elle est naturelle, et que, le jour où nous
en connaîtrions les conditions, il ne nous serait pas plus
nécessaire, pour obtenir un effet télépathique, d'attendre
une hallucination vraie, que nous n'avons besoin aujourd'hui,
quand nous voulons voir l'étincelle électrique,
d'attendre que le ciel veuille bien nous en donner le
spectacle pendant une scène d'orage....</p>

<p>Pour ma part, quand je repasse dans ma mémoire les
résultats de l'admirable enquête poursuivie continuellement
par vous pendant plus de trente ans, quand je pense
à toutes les précautions que vous avez prises pour éviter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
l'erreur, quand je vois comment, dans la plupart des cas
que vous avez retenus, le récit de l'hallucination avait été
fait à une ou plusieurs personnes, souvent même noté par
écrit, avant que l'hallucination eût été reconnue véridique,
quand je tiens compte du nombre énorme des faits et surtout
de leur ressemblance entre eux, de leur air de famille,
de la concordance de tant de témoignages indépendants les
uns des autres, tous examinés, contrôlés, soumis à la
critique,&mdash;je suis porté à croire à la télépathie de même
que je crois, par exemple, à la défaite de l'Invincible Armada.
Ce n'est pas la certitude mathématique que me
donne la démonstration du théorème de Pythagore; ce
n'est pas la certitude physique où je suis de la vérité de
la loi de la chute des corps; c'est du moins toute la certitude
qu'on obtient en matière historique ou judiciaire.</p>

<p>Nos corps sont extérieurs les uns aux autres dans
l'espace; et nos consciences, en tant qu'attachées à ces
corps, sont extérieures les unes aux autres aussi. Mais si
elles ne tiennent au corps que par une partie d'elles-mêmes,
on peut conjecturer que, pour le reste, elles ne
sont pas aussi nettement séparées. Loin de moi la pensée
de considérer la personnalité comme une simple apparence,
ou comme une réalité éphémère, ou comme une
dépendance de l'activité cérébrale! Mais il est fort possible
qu'entre les diverses personnalités s'accomplissent
sans cesse des échanges comparables aux phénomènes d'endosmose.
Si cette endosmose existe, on peut prévoir que
la nature aura pris toutes ses précautions pour en neutraliser
l'effet, et que certains mécanismes devront être
spécialement chargés de rejeter dans l'inconscient les
représentations ainsi provoquées, car elles seraient fort
embarrassantes dans la vie de tous les jours. Telle ou
telle de ces représentations pourrait cependant, ici encore,
passer en contrebande, surtout quand les mécanismes inhibitifs
fonctionnent mal; et sur elles encore s'exercerait
la "recherche psychique."</p>

<h2>TWO NEGLECTED VIRTUES</h2>


<p>Two virtues are generally ignored in the systematic
books on morals and in the informal admonitions of
fathers to sons, yet upon these virtues depends most of the
ease, delight and profit which comes to us in human fellowship.
Let me illustrate.</p>

<p>There is in the Metropolitan Museum a very handsome
funeral slab of a certain bailiff of Sesostris I.,
Menthu-Weser. This steward prepared his own epitaph
with conviction and most carefully. Among many assertions
of his own merits the most striking is, "I was one
who really listened." Here seems evidence that in Egypt
early in the second millennium before Christ the virtues
of reticence and tact were valued. Ever since they have
had scant enough recognition in the world. In our own
days particularly the robust virtues have the preference.
We acclaim the square deal. We are socially minded,
meaning that we aggressively mind the business of others.
Naturally such quiet and unsensational virtues as tact
and reticence are gone out of fashion. In a land where all
are equals, tact is likely to pass for truckling, or worse for
condescension, whereas reticence must perforce be abhorrent
to a generation which has trusted to an unlimited publicity
the remedying of most earthly ills. Lest we think too
hardly of our own generation, let me hasten to repeat that
no age has done full justice to these dubious virtues. Holy
Writ, to be sure, extols the value of the "word in season,"
while to the much married Solomon is ascribed the proverbs,
"He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life, but
he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction." But
this sinister aspect of loquaciousness is evidently proper to
an oriental despotism and not to a free republic. We gain
but faint glimpses of our unscheduled virtues from moralist
and theologian. The Roman Church, always meticulously
analytical of both the virtues and vices, finds no
official rubric either for tact or reticence. These capacities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
indispensable stay and safeguard of the confessional, may
indeed have been regarded as the trade secret of the clergy,
and, as tending to produce too astute a laity, unfit for promulgation.
However that be, it is not to the pious manuals
that we must go for examples of tactful sayings or happy
silences, but to the extra-clerical expressions of such vagrom
clerics as Boccaccio and Bandello. From their collections
of ready and witty retorts many instances of tact
might be selected, but neither of these storytellers can be
said conspicuously to illustrate the virtue of reticence.</p>

<p>Reticence in fact is perhaps the most unpopular of virtues.
What most people like is loquaciousness and its
kindred vice tactlessness. The reticent man is seldom that
meritorious thing, a good mixer, and he suffers from the
suspicion of moroseness. Open-heartedness, on the contrary,
is charitably credited to the habitual chatterer. He
is, as the Irish happily say, an easy spoken man, joyously
gregarious. A similar credit attaches itself to the habitually
tactless person. You know where to find him. He
speaks his mind without regard to your sensibilities. At
bottom, an expression which a clever French writer has
shrewdly remarked always means exceptionally, he is
surely amiable, a thoroughly good sort&mdash;at bottom. It
is significant, however, that reticence and tact may be partially
condoned by the possession of great wealth. Only
recently a multimillionaire won prominence in his obscure
class, and a nickname, merely on his silence, while another
who was all things to all men, and to many women, is still
remembered as a prince charming whether among sportsmen
or statesmen. All of which goes to show that our
twin virtues are essentially aristocratic or at least capitalistic,
and appraised accordingly. A statesman or politician,
being in a democracy a hybrid between the classes
and masses, must practice the virtue of tactfulness but by
the same token resolutely eschew that of reticence. The
political aspirant is heard for his much speaking, and when
silent may be said to cease to exist.</p>

<p>Now for such misvaluations there is generally a specious
and respectable reason. Indeed one reason will doubtless
explain nine-tenths of popular delusions&mdash;the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
judging not from the long but from the short run. The
blurting way is the easiest way of meeting a situation and
wins the praise of frankness. It takes time and pains to
weigh a situation and adjust one's attitude to that of another,
and such considerateness often passes for obliquity.
Of course the blurting habit itself is often merely a form
of pose; confidence men practice it for good business reasons.
The man who overrides you will as often be pursuing
a tactic as he cajoles you. Indeed the professionally
downright man is often more devious than the tactful person.
Battering you with a confusing flow of argument,
imposing his will at random, he is precisely the man you do
not know where to find. You yield to him in small matters
out of weariness and avoid him in great. But at any
particular moment he does seem outspoken, and he leaves
a general impression of strength and candor. Beyond such
false appearances an untrained mind will rarely inquire.
The tactful man who watches his opportunity to set his
matter agreeably before you, taking you on your best side,
is proceeding quite straight-forwardly, but to an impatient
or unattentive or irresolute person the processes of tact
may well seem both dilatory and crooked. Thus the
merely assertive man will usually get undue credit on first
hearing while the tactful man generally wins his standing
only on prolonged acquaintance. The great painter Delacroix,
a fastidious man if there ever was one, used to deplore
the ease with which at first meeting persons of a certain
persistent aggressiveness took him in.</p>

<p>Talkativeness, like tactlessness, has an undeniable face
value that largely disappears on inspection. Ten times a
day in casual contacts it might be pleasanter and easier
to deal with a chatty person than with a silent one, that is,
easier and pleasanter for one to whom time was small
object. The commercial traveller is proverbially loquacious,
though in the higher ranges of the calling doubtless a
businesslike taciturnity prevails. An ex-grocer's clerk has
been publishing some amusing confessions in a popular
magazine&mdash;in our unreticent age confessions singularly
abound&mdash;and he tells that his sole instructions were
"Chin the women." Evidently what was assumed of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
fair customers was rather amenability than intelligence or
thrift. In a world where there was little or no intelligence,
tact and reticence would be unnecessary virtues, rational
persuasion being impossible. In such a world the human
compact would imply infinite blundering and unrestrained
conversability. Such is still the unwritten law of life
among people who have not wholly reached the conscious
stage. "Yes, I burnt it," my cook says beamingly with the
air of inviting a compliment, carelessness being quite normal
in her code.</p>

<p>The trouble with the virtues of reticence and tact&mdash;and
naturally the ground of their unpopularity&mdash;is precisely
that they are products not of the heart but of the
head. To possess these qualities opens one to the suspicion
of being a cold fish. Nobody objects to the warmer and
less rationalized virtues. If we accept the convenient and
I believe quite psychologically defensible list drawn up by
the mediæval schoolmen, we shall find that the standard
virtues are almost without exception of the heart. Obviously
this is true of the prime theological virtues, Faith,
Hope, and Charity. Despite utilitarian interpretations,
these remain temperamental qualities. We are born believing,
hopeful, and loving, or not. And even such
of us as are deficient in these merits by heredity or from
policy at least will accord to the entire Pauline triad the
tribute of a distant admiration. When we approach the
pagan list, Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice,
the virtues begin to make enemies. With Fortitude no
one quarrels, for that is an instinctive virtue, an expression
largely of ample circulation and steady nerves. It is the
only secular virtue that is completely popular. Justice
may share such esteem in a measure, for the inclination towards
the square deal and a rough sense of its needfulness
are deeply seated in the race. Prudence and Temperance,
on the contrary, within which larger categories our special
virtues of reticence and tact are comprised, have ever been
grudgingly practiced and even theoretically disallowed.
Humanity has ever boasted a sporting contingent to whom
to be prudent and temperate was anathema. The deeply
rooted feeling that every young man must sow his wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
oats is the express disavowal of these virtues so far as male
youth is concerned. Reticence and tact, then, must be
content to share the unpopularity of all the cerebral virtues.
The man who is delicately considerate of his neighbor's
case must be content to be regarded as a schemer, and
he who cautiously weighs his utterances must bear the
reproach of ungeniality.</p>

<p>But as soon as a society becomes conscious and complicated,
tact and reticence assume high and even indispensable
value. No physician who had the confidential ways of
a country postmistress would be tolerated. Why is a parvenu
stranded in a society which may consist of his inferiors
in capacity and morals? Because he has no clear
notion of his attitude to his new fellows or of theirs to him
and to each other, he lacks the tact for an untried situation.
The grace of a reticent observation may gain him
time and save him appalling blunders. If his social intelligence
be keen, he will adopt such Fabian tactics until some
opening in mutual sympathy establishes itself. But this
implies reticence. As a matter of fact, he will usually be
restive, and will talk at random and constrainedly, being
ignorant of what that particular company likes to hear
said or left unsaid. His utterances successively betray
him and he progressively writes himself down an ass. Nor
is his case made better, as humanitarians confidently profess,
by kindliness. His heart may be the best in the world
and understanding of the minds and manners of new people
denied him. His kindliness may condone the spectacle he
cuts, but to make his position good wants intelligence
which good-heartedness may supplement but not supplant.
Nor is his dilemma due, as Socialists will perhaps maintain,
merely to the fact that his difference is arrogantly
ascribed by snobbishness to personal inferiority. In the
same circumstances a far humbler person, a forest-guide
or a sailor, will comport himself agreeably and without
constraint. Perhaps the close quarters of tent and forecastle
conduce to tolerant understanding between very
different individuals, and set natural limits to forced or
heedless talk.</p>

<p>Between the reticent and the merely taciturn person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
there is constant confusion. The silent man may simply
be devoid of interests, morose and with nothing to say.
A trappist is merely speechless; not reticent. The reticent
man has much to say, but for reason says only the
part that his judgment approves. He is his own censor.
His abstentions are due to a fundamental conviction that
many things never need to be said at all, and that most
personal difficulties best adjust themselves with fewest
words. His attitude evinces respect for certain privacies.
His intimate business is not in the show window nor on
the bargain counter, and he assumes as much of the personal
concerns of his fellows. If there be a human type
peculiarly intolerable, it is that which insists on stated
explanations of every trifling misunderstanding. There
are minds for which no slightest transaction is outlawed
and no statute of limitations admitted. What shall that
woman say who wastes five minutes explaining why she
didn't bow to me yesterday when a real occasion of conference
arises? How shall I respect the man who insists on
divulging most physiologically the mysteries of his bed
and board? How shall I bear that my own humble Lares
and Penates be bywords on reckless lips? On the whole
the finest gentleman I have ever met was the Japanese
Samurai and art critic, the late Okakura Kakuzo. I recall
as vividly his courteous and expectant silences as I
do his always eloquent and brilliant discourse. Indulgent
to the small talk of others, he declined to share it. If he
ever gave utterance to a mere prejudice or to any petty
personal concern, it was not in my hearing. He appeared
to husband himself until the talk should take a wide impersonal
range, and then his comment was fervent and
illuminating. A noted American poet and critic has somewhat
similar habits. His prolonged silences are comfortable,
even deferential, his rare speech instinct with sympathetic
understanding of men and books and nature.
The late John LaFarge who was in congenial society a
continuous talker offered an interesting equivalent for reticence
in the allusiveness of his touch and in a beautiful
perception of the kind of sympathetic response you would
have made had you not been better occupied in listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to him. He had what most free talkers signally lack, perfect
tact.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most distressing and alarming feature of
our American civilization is the complete lack of any ideal
of reticence. Scientists babble for the press, clergymen
fan the prurient flame of curiosity after each especially
noxious <i>cause célèbre</i>, chorus girls divulge the hygiene of
their personal charms, nameless outrage becomes the favorite
theme of venal dramatists, young girls make small
talk of the pros and cons of marriage and free love, shallow
journalists glorify the vices of the city slums, an unprincipled
press and an untrained laity freely review the findings
of the courts, clever but irresponsible scribblers pillory
wholesale our industry and finance&mdash;in short we live
in an age when to expose anything is the highest good, and
to conceal anything passes for a manner of treason. When
everything conceivable has been said, boggled and muddled
out, a reaction must come. Wearied by the vociferations
of the nostrum vendors, the plain man will come to
realize that what is read counts little in comparison with
what is marked and inwardly digested. In a thoroughly
unreticent age we get mere data, much of it false, far too
fast. We have yet to learn the elementary lesson of the
Stoics, to learn and fix upon that which concerns ourselves.
A chief merit of the Pragmatic philosophy, with most of
which I cordially disagree, is to have shown that we must
bring words and thought to the test of action, and a very
simple test of the worth or worthlessness of talk or writing
on social matters would be whether the residual impression
is a mere perturbation, or titillation, or a firm purpose to
do some definite remedial thing. If I am taught to be
merely uneasy about the sharp practices of my retail grocer,
or more likely of his wholesale grocer, without seeking
for tangible relief and redress, my last estate is worse than
my first. I merely eat in bitterness of spirit the preservatives
and adulterants which otherwise I might have negotiated
at the cost of a slight dyspepsia. Where Mr. Roosevelt
has most deserved ill of the republic is in fomenting
this general atmosphere of suspicion in the people while
lodging both the recognition of the criminal and his proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
punishment in some transcendental capacity of his own
personality. He is the Dr. Munyon of the diseased body
politic, and his power consists largely in continual and
breathless reiteration of universal symptoms under which
each man may have the grateful illusion of registering his
own particular ache. Mr. Roosevelt seems to me a supreme
example of the inconveniences, nay danger, of incorrigible
and thoroughly well meaning garrulity in a political leader.
But Mr. Roosevelt's tact is often as noteworthy as his
prolixity, even his indiscretions are calculated or inspired
to meet the call of the occasion. Why of X? was
his remark when a scholar of international repute was introduced
at the White House as "of X University."</p>

<p>The case of Mr. Roosevelt and in a quite different sense
that of John LaFarge make me question sometimes what
really seems axiomatic that no free talker can be completely
tactful. Carlyle, Ruskin, Gladstone seem to illustrate
the rule, and even Lowell, as his intimates admit,
long retained certain asperities. It seems obvious that
one who has never quietly looked into himself and seen
clearly, nor studied his fellow man at leisure and accurately,
can acquire the art of compatibility. To think
otherwise is to assert that the tactful man, poetlike, is
born not made. Were this so, cases of tact among young
children should be fairly common, and I doubt if the fondest
parent could supply any genuine instance. So I feel
that such apparent exceptions to the rule as John LaFarge
and Mr. Roosevelt would fall into line if one knew the
whole story. There must have been a time when both,
like the steward, Menthu-Weser, listened much and took
keenest note of the ways and moods of other men.</p>

<p>Tact is so readily divined and so difficult of definition
that I have avoided what might seem an essayist's plain
duty. Yet a tactful reader will not require a pedantic formulation
in these matters of common experience. I suppose
the basis of tact is a good understanding with one's
self, a comprehension of the permanent disposition and
passing moods of those with whom one deals, a desire to
approach men on their best side, combined with the force
and initiative that enable one to act promptly on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
knowledge. Tact may or may not be coupled with expansive
kind-heartedness. In such association it gains an
added grace. Tact implies at the least a vivid human curiosity
hardly distinguishable from sympathy. If it were
otherwise there would be no motive for exercising tact in
cases which involve no material interest. And I suppose
the genuinely tactful person finds his greatest incentives
and rewards in emergencies that offer only the satisfaction
of a neatly played game. In the whole matter the sense of
timeliness is everything. To wait for a softening expression,
to suppress a cherished witticism the appositeness of
which has passed, to exhaust without insistence a happy
vein, to rise sharply to any worthy lure and refuse an unworthy
one without offence&mdash;such are some of the delightful
and legitimate arts of the tactful person. Whether
men or women possess these gentle arts in fuller measure
would be matter for a separate essay. The impression
prevails that women do, indeed the phrase "feminine
tact" is quite stereotyped among us. I presume that a
scrutiny of the memoirs of the most highly developed society
of modern times, the French salons of the old régime,
would confirm this judgment. From my own limited experience
I can only say that while I have met ten tactful
women for one tactful man, the consummate exemplars
of this virtue in my acquaintance have been of the so-called
sterner sex, and I am inclined to believe that the
finest flower of considerateness grows best in the rocky soil
of the masculine intelligence. The mere fact that the personal
adjustment is more difficult between men with no
reconciling tradition of chivalry prevailing may make for
finer transactions. Possibly too, the absence of a conventional
sex loyalty, a relatively detached and impersonal
habit of thought, a somewhat ruthless will to understand,
a practice of moving resolutely in difficult affairs, may
make the tact of a man when it occurs at all a more precious
and complicated product. So at least it strikes one
who confessedly knows the world largely through books.
I would rather have overheard the talk and silences of
David and Jonathan, or for that matter of Charles Eliot
Norton and Carlyle, than that of any man and woman or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of any two women recorded by historian or novelist. If,
fair reader, this be treason, make the most of it.</p>

<p>To the notion that tact requires both a perceptive and
an active part, I must for a moment return. The fact
seems to me to explain the oft discussed case of the shy
person. In my observation shy people are usually quite
delicately perceptive, victims in fact of an almost morbid
open-mindedness and sympathy. Where they lack is in
prompt decision between diverging courses, in the sense
of relativity which brings the right word or silence at the
right moment, and precisely and only for that moment's
sake. I fancy many shy persons are not egotists, as an
impatient and genial world is prone to hold them, but
absolutists, expecting of human intercourse a sort of
abstract fitness in the light of an eternal aspect which for
the really tactful man has no practical existence. In
heaven and probably in hell the shy should get along capitally.
In the celestial domain active tact would be unnecessary&mdash;it
would merely trouble the perpetual beatitude;
in the nether realm tact would simply mitigate those tense
affinities and antipathies which are implied in a future
punitive state. The damned, if really tactful folk, would
never have to be strictly regimented among their infernal
peers with the inevitability which a Dante or a Swedenborg
describes. In the sphere of intelligence indeed inevitability
has no meaning. Alternatives always exist. A determinist's
god cannot be tactful, and if Professors James
and Royce have been allured by the idea of a conditioned
deity, I fancy it has been largely with the hope of shading
the arid conception of omnipotence with one of the most
amiable human qualities. It is a compromise which the
Christian effects less philosophically in the doctrine of
the God-man. Yet the Jesus of the Gospels remains for
the philosopher much more of a God than of a man, despite
the efforts of orthodox and skeptical criticism to elucidate
the historic figure. His sayings transcend tact, and
the Jews, eminently a negotiating, compromising and
tactful race, bore true report when they said "He speaks
as never man spake."</p>

<p>Such serious and remote but I trust illuminating aspects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of our topic may merely be glanced at. In closing I may
note that while the finest exhibitions of tact arise between
individuals or in small groups, there is also a collective
type of tact which must be mastered by the artist, the
actor, and the orator. St. Paul manifested it in the highest
degree when he addressed the curious Babists, Vedantists,
Christian Scientists, Spiritualists, Vitalists, Relativists,
and Materialists (my Greek has lapsed so I offer
modern equivalents) of Athens as men "pre-eminently
religious." And it is characteristic of the touch and
go quality of every sort of tact that nothing much moved
the loiterers on Mars Hill except the Apostle's beginning.
Need I add that tact itself loyally obeys the law of measure
and occasion which it imposes on its subservient material?
The high exercise of tact requires high occasions. Of this
sort was John Hancock's grim and enlightening jest in the
Continental Congress on all hanging together lest they all
hang separately. It took perhaps a singularly tactless personality
to husband this supreme and isolated flash for a
lifetime until the right occasion should occur. Merely one
among countless examples of Lincoln's tact was his solicitous
inquiry as to the brand of Grant's whiskey when a
meddler brought gossip of the great General's potations.
Charles II's famous apology for unconscionable delay in
dying is frequently cited as a consummate example of tact.
To me it seems merely witty, containing as it does a hint
that the attendants had let something of impatience or
weariness transpire.</p>

<p>It is the negative part of tact always to save at least two
faces&mdash;leaving neither party to a transaction discomforted.
The most solemn example of entire tactlessness
within my knowledge was perpetrated by a very learned
man, the by no means inconspicuous father of a far more
famous son, Dr. John Rubens. During a prolonged absence
of that rather unsatisfactory husband, William of
Orange, Dr. John deeply engaged the volatile affections of
Queen Anna. When the affair was uncovered he wrote
to the Prince a letter of apology, the tenor of which was
that such infelicities had been the common lot of monarchs,
as history showed, and the present mishap was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
more tolerable that he himself, Dr. John Rubens, was a
man of parts and station, a Doctor of Laws from no mean
university, and at court the equal of a baron. It does not
appear that such plain intimation that the queen might
have erred with some base fellow, perhaps a mere Bachelor
of Arts, in any way comforted the taciturn Prince. When
Dr. Rubens left prison it was not because of this letter but
through the importunity of a singularly loyal wife. To
emphasize the relativity of tact let me cite a family anecdote,
the appositeness of which must condone a certain
lack of reticence in its telling. My father once in conducting
a defence before a magistrate, by directing a single
crucial question to the plaintiff put him overtly in the
wrong, and noting the judge's involuntary nod of assent,
rested the case, promptly obtaining a favorable verdict.
As regards the judge this was perfect tact, but not as regards
the client. He rightly expected a more ample parade
of professional skill and probably still grudges the fee.</p>

<p>How much needless travail and fuss a truly reticent and
tactful man might spare himself and his neighbors&mdash;privacies
profaned, trifling misunderstandings magnified,
maimed reputations, distracted aims, thwarted accomplishment!
Upon all this I could still enlarge, but I am
already rebuked by the ambiguously smiling shade of Samuel
Butler of "Erewhon" who remarks in his "Notebooks:"</p>

<p>"No man should try even to allude to the greater part
of what he sees in his subject, and there is hardly a limit
to what he may omit. What is required is that he shall
say what he elects to say discreetly, that he shall be quick
to see the gist of a matter, and give it pithily without
either prolixity or stint of words."</p>

<h2>THE UNFERMENTED CABINET</h2>


<p>Mr. Bunn of Bloomington, Illinois, has put into a
book the story how in 1860 he went up to Mr.
Lincoln's room in the State House of Illinois, and met
Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, just coming down. Mr. Bunn
said to Mr. Lincoln:</p>

<p>"You don't want to put that man into your cabinet."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because he thinks he is a great deal bigger than you
are."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know of any other men who think they
are bigger than I am?"</p>

<p>"I do not know that I do. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to put them all in my cabinet!"</p>

<p>Perhaps that was the principle that President Wilson
went on when he invited Mr. Bryan to be secretary of
state. The objection of prudent on-lookers to Mr. Bryan
as a member of Mr. Wilson's cabinet was very much Mr.
Bunn's objection to Chase. But Lincoln took Chase, and
also Seward and Stanton to whom the same objection
applied, and Wilson took Bryan.</p>

<p>That argued confidence in something. Maybe it was a
confidence in some qualities and convictions of Mr.
Bryan; in his sincerity, and his loyalty to some aims that
Mr. Wilson wished his administration to express. Or it
might have been a token of Mr. Wilson's confidence in
himself and his political intentions. But in the case of no
other cabinet officer did that sort of confidence find that
sort of expression. Not one of the rest of them would be
picked out as a man who thought himself a bigger man
than Wilson. Except perhaps Mr. Lane, they were all
fairly green hands with almost everything to learn about
the business of conducting the federal government. Mr.
Redfield and Mr. Burleson had been in Congress, but
none of them had ever been a conspicuous figure in national
politics.</p>

<p>They were not inexperienced men. Mr. McAdoo had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
had experience as a practicing lawyer and as president of
the company that financed, built, and operated the first
tube under the Hudson River. Mr. McReynolds had
been assistant attorney-general, and had been long retained
afterwards by the Department of Justice in matters
relating to enforcement of the anti-trust law, especially
in the prosecution of the tobacco cases. He was known
and respected as a competent lawyer. Mr. Garrison had
been a newspaper reporter and had held a judicial office
in New Jersey. Dr. Houston was a specialist in economics,
had been president of two universities, and came to Washington
fresh from the work of reorganizing and developing
the important Washington University of St. Louis. Mr.
Daniels had once been chief clerk of the Department of
the Interior, and afterwards a successful newspaper editor
and publisher in North Carolina and a member of the
Democratic national committee. Mr. Lane, drafted from
the Interstate Commerce Commission, was a man of excellent
ability, had had a very valuable experience in governmental
concerns, and was probably the best equipped
for his new work of any of the President's official family.
And Mr. Burleson and Mr. Redfield, as said, had been
members of Congress. But not one of these gentlemen was
in the enjoyment of a national renown. Mr. Bryan had
all of that that there was in the new cabinet. Indeed Mr.
Bryan had dominated the party so long and so little to the
liking of the older leaders of the Democrats, that, except in
the South, few other of the abler politicians of the party
had been able to keep in the public sight. Everybody
knew Judge Parker, but he, though a loyal Democrat, was
not conclusively consecrated to the cause of the New Freedom,
and it was not expected that he would be in the Cabinet.
Governor Harmon was well known and perhaps
more available, but, so far as known, he was not invited.
Mr. Underwood, with the work of making a new tariff law
cut out for him, was indispensable in his place as leader of
the House, and could not be disturbed. Mr. Clark, the
speaker, was in a like case, too well off where he was, to be
moved. So the new cabinet was nearly all new timber,
and not only new but fairly green. The President, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
seemed, new himself to the business of directing government,
had assembled a group of assistants that seemed all
to be in a like case, and they would all start in together to
learn their new business.</p>

<p>It worried some observers to see such untried hands on
the levers of government. "The Unfermented Cabinet"
Mr. Bryan's notions of diplomatic dinners have led some
of them to call it, and a great deal of space has been given
up in the public prints since March to its processes of
fermentation. Observers have watched them with great
curiosity, also with amusement, also at times with anxiety.
It has been a matter of importance to the country what
sort of a council the fermentation would produce; what
manner of men these councillors and assistants of the
President would turn out to be, and with how much efficiency
they would finally adjust themselves to their important
duties. There were forecasts a-plenty; frequent
prophecies in particular of the speedy separation of Mr.
Bryan from the official family. There have been wild
cries to the President from newspapers claiming to be influential,
to discharge this or that one,&mdash;Mr. McReynolds
because of an apparent error of judgment about a prosecution
in California; Mr. McAdoo for something else;
Mr. Bryan for official inefficiency and unofficial activity;
others for other reasons. But the cabinet still holds together
as it began, and is still apparently harmonious, and
its fermentation still goes on.</p>

<p>The underlying idea about the fermentation has been
that when it had accomplished its work, the novelties of
method and deportment peculiar to Mr. Wilson's administration
would fade out, his heads of Departments would
behave more and more like their predecessors, and the
business of government would gradually conform to the
conventions that obtained when the new hands took hold.
Now the country has been kept so busy watching its new
President that it has not been able to give more than a
broken attention to his secretaries, and only the more
obstreperous of them have been much under scrutiny.
But it has been impossible to overlook Mr. Bryan, and it
cannot be said that in his case there is yet any sign that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
fermentation is producing the expected result. He has
been all along, and continues up to latest advices to be,
impressively different from anyone who ever sat before
in the chief seat in the State Department. No one before
him set grape juice before ambassadors at his dinner-table;
no one before him went out on the lecture platform to
supplement his official salary, thereby combining a particularly
ostentatious form of money-getting with the
duties of the leading place in the cabinet. Secretary
Bryan has been very widely and enthusiastically criticised
for these departures from tradition, but that does not
seem to have troubled him in the least. Why should it?
For nearly twenty years he has been an object of criticism
for about two-thirds of his countrymen and has flourished
under it because the other third liked him. To about two-thirds
of the Democratic party he was acceptable as a
candidate. To the other third and to the Republicans
he was not acceptable and therefore he could never be
elected President. But a third of the voters and the people
they represent count up to thirty millions of people, and
that is a good many. It is a valuable following for a politician,
a very valuable collection for a lecturer. To the
thirty million, ambassadors are a good deal of a joke, and
they are amused to have grape juice set before these
dignitaries. More than that some of them are gratified
because they consider grape juice a moral beverage, and
consider it exemplary to offer it to exalted personages who
ought to want it, though they don't. And doubtless a
great many people are delighted to welcome Mr. Bryan
on the lecture platform. They like that sort of intercourse
with a high officer of government. Is it not <i>their</i> government?
Is it not <i>their</i> secretary? And he is a fine performer
too! Clap! clap! come their echoing palms together
and freely drop their dollars into the hat. Why, to
be sure, should Mr. Bryan forsake the practices that please
all the thirty million friends to whose favor he owes his
present preferment, to please fastidious persons who never
have believed in him and never will?</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that Mr. Bryan has nerve. There
are those who complain because President Wilson has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
not admonished him to be more modish in his deportment.
But President Wilson has been very busy, and has needed
the help of Mr. Bryan and his thirty million admirers, and
apparently has had it. There is concurrence of report that
Mr. Bryan has been very loyal and very useful to the
administration. A man with thirty million friends can
be quite helpful to a President, or can be quite troublesome.
To leave such a person to follow, under the law,
the promptings of his own spirit in matters of taste, seems
no more than a reasonable discretion.</p>

<p>And there is another view that may be taken of Mr.
Bryan's Chautauqua orations. He likes to talk to the
people. He does it very successfully. His ability to do it
had been the chief source of his strength. The great newspapers
of the country are pretty generally hostile to him.
If he has something to say, his preference for saying it
with his own voice rather than to have it filtered through
more or less hostile newspapers, may be understood. Our
newspapers have not, collectively, a high reputation for
giving accurate reports of the public utterances of public
men. Any contemporary politician who has a loud
enough voice and sufficient physical energy in using it to
make him in any measure independent of newspapers will
have considerable, intelligent public sympathy in his reliance
on his own gifts, and a desire to keep them exercised.</p>

<p>But there is something more than Mr. Bryan's thirty
million (estimated) friends to keep the President harmonious
with him. He is very considerably harmonious in
spirit and political desires with the President. They have
a very inclusive identity of general purpose. Mr. Bryan
is as heartily in favor of the New Freedom as Mr. Wilson
is. That is a kind of political religion in which both of
them have profound faith. What truly religious people
differ about, as a general thing, is not the controlling facts
of their faith, but less essential matters; side issues, and
very often errors. Catholics and Protestants have always
agreed as to the main and really important facts of Christianity,
but they have fought ferociously about processes,
mechanisms and details. Free silver was a detail of politics.
Mr. Bryan led his faction into the wilderness about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
that. Government ownership of railroads is another detail;
state insurance of bank deposits is another. Mr.
Bryan has an unsurpassed gift of getting it wrong on his
details, but in his great general aim to keep the great body
of people free from domination by the strong hands he is
probably sound and sincere. It must be that that has
saved him alive. He is a bold man with a large voice and
the habit of domination. He hates bosses who are in
politics for purposes of plunder; he hates all the agencies
that seem to him to purpose to monopolize the people's
heritage&mdash;trusts because he thinks they want to monopolize
business, "Wall Street" because he thinks it wants
to monopolize money, Ryan and Tammany because he
thinks they want to monopolize and commercialize politics.
Of course Mr. Bryan is interested in Bryan, and is
heartily for that statesman, but he seems also to be quite
heartily for human liberty, the rights of man, peace in the
world, and the greatest happiness of the most people. It
really looks as if he cared so much for these perennial
enthusiasms as to be willing if they cannot come through
himself, to help them come through someone else. And
it looks as though he thought they might come considerably
through Mr. Wilson, and was working to make them
do it. Mr. Bryan's ethics are good enough. It is his
economics that have made the trouble. He behaves as if
at last he had found someone who could show him how to
do what he wanted done. He seems to see in Mr. Wilson a
man who is moving in the direction he wants to go and
knows the road. He never before had leadership of that
kind offered to him. All the other eminent Democratic
guides whom he has been invited to support have seemed
to him to be merely persons who knew the road to something
he wished to avoid.</p>

<p>Confidence is a great harmonizer. If you think a man
is going your way and knows the road better than you do,
it is no great hardship to go along with him. The chief
result that has come to notice of the fermentation, so far,
in President Wilson's cabinet is an impression of profound
confidence of the cabinet in the President. So far as heard
from, they all seem to feel that he is going their way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
either knows the road or can find it. It will be recalled
that at Princeton Mr. Wilson was not so successful in
winning the confidence of his advisers. That was because
a certain proportion of them were not going his way. It
has come to be recognized that he is of no use to anybody
who is not going in the same general direction as he is. He
will stop and talk; will persuade if he can; will wait if
necessary, but he seems to have a prejudice against deviation
that reminds one of Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress.
You may pave a road with gold bricks; grade it,
smooth it, dust it; it will never look attractive to Mr. Wilson
unless it leads where he wants to go. That is the impression
he makes,&mdash;an impression of a stubborn man
very tenacious of purposes very well thought out. One
laughs to think of the heads that are still sore with trying
to butt him out of his course at Princeton; of his rapid
extrication of his interests from political ties the most intimate
and useful, that threatened to give an impression
that his feet were intangled! One laughs to think of the
<i>World</i> a few months ago using its editorial megaphone to
order him to discharge three members of his cabinet. It
is doubtful if the <i>World</i> would be so ready with that kind
of suggestion to-day.</p>

<p>Nine months of fermentation have left the cabinet considerably
clarified. We begin to think of it less as an aggregation
of individuals, and more as a team bent on putting
over certain definite accomplishments in government.
It seems united in spirit; a team of willing workers under
a captain in whom they have not only confidence, but
pride. It was expected that Mr. Wilson would be hard to
work with. It was expected that his defect as an executive
officer would be an inability to enlist the sympathy of his
colleagues and subordinates. People said he had no magnetism,
that he was over suspicious and distrustful: that
he would not dare to tie up to anyone, and that no one
would dare to tie up to him. But, so far, these expectations
do not find much support; in fact, so far as anybody
knows, his cabinet is an unusually happy family. Men
are working with tireless devotion to make his administration
succeed. They are doing so not so much because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
they like the man (though they do like him) as because
they like the cause. They follow him, support him, help
him, advise him, defer to his judgment, because he has
impressed them with the notion that he knows what he is
about, and is equal to what he undertakes and that under
his leadership certain definite improvements in the social
and economic apparatus of our country may be accomplished.</p>

<p>Soldiers love a general not because of how he parts his
hair, but because he can win battles. President Wilson
has produced the impression that he can win battles. It is
that that interests him; not the buttons on his coat, nor to
have the people holler when they see him. He cannot win
any battle without plenty of help. How does he get the
help? Is it by close attention to details of deportment?</p>

<p>Not at all. His deportment is agreeable so far as known,
but it does not seem to be his chief concern.</p>

<p>Is it by extreme solicitude to avoid small mistakes and
ingratiate all influential persons?</p>

<p>No. He makes his share of small mistakes and sometimes
scandalizes the influential, but it does not seem to
matter.</p>

<p>He gets help because he seems to be worth helping;
because he gives his mind not to the retention of power,
but to the use of it in accomplishing what he was chosen
to accomplish. He has signed a tariff bill. That was one
great battle won. He had to have splendid support to win
it, but he got the support. Has he rested on that victory?
Not a minute. Now it is the currency bill and it will be
that until he signs a currency bill that will satisfy the
country. Then it will be the trusts, and the Lord knows
what.</p>

<p>But it is safe to bet that Mr. Wilson also knows what.
He has thought out a great many problems of government.
He will always know of things that ought to be done to
improve the life of the people, and he will always have a
program for doing the next thing on his list, and will always
push it as hard as seems to him practicable and, probably,
much harder than will seem expedient to most observers.
He has shown himself to be a great driving force, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
kind of one that gains ground because of the forces that
he can carry with him. What he is after will always be as
clear as he can make it, and it will be important, and those
that are for it will be confident that they will get it if they
win, and those that are against it will know what they are
against. There is a good prospect for clean political and
economic issues in this country for some time to come;
issues about which people will have to think, and on which
they will divide. The question is going to be how much
improvement the country can stand in a given time. The
patient is on the operating table. No doubt he needs to
have a good deal done, but if his pulse begins to sink, off
he will have to come, and wait until he gets stronger.
Otherwise the disposition is to make a new man of him and
do it now.</p>

<p>And so, small matters are not going to make so much
difference as they might if less important changes were
imminent. It may be true that the trousers of all the
cabinet bag at the knees, but nobody cares much. Mr.
Bryan may talk in the Chautauqua circuit, and do lots
of other unusual things, Mr. McAdoo's department
may make mistakes in its income-tax circulars, Mr. Daniels
may behave at times too much like Mr. Daniels,
Mr. McReynolds's young men may show a too voluble
zeal in prosecution, but it will be a mistake to expand occurrences
of that size into evidences of administrative
failure. Cromwell had a wart on his nose, but still was
esteemed an efficient man. His trousers would undoubtedly
have bagged at the knees if he had worn trousers,
but his statue stands at last by the Parliament House in
London.</p>

<p>President Wilson's administration is likely to win or
lose on wagers of considerable size. It may be a good administration
or it may be a bad one, but there is no sign
or symptom that it is going to be a piker.</p>

<h2>A NEEDED UNPOPULAR REFORM</h2>


<p>The American people in their frugal rural days enjoyed
their freedom, knew all their neighbors, and
governed themselves simply and directly. They knew
personally the men they elected. Now bosses govern
them, and the men they elect are unknown to the voters.
The republic is rich, the people are many. Still possessed
of that spirit of liberty which Edmund Burke noted as
characteristic of the American colonists, and still reaching
for complete self-government, they have grasped too much,
and have lost their grip on what is essential. They have
seen the setting up of secret oligarchies in all the chief
cities and states. The head of the most considerable of
these oligarchies, regnant save in times of extraordinary
protest and agitation, is virtually king of a tributary city
and state, whose population is over thrice that of the
original thirteen Colonies, whose public expenditures are
three hundred millions of dollars yearly, and whose wealth
amounts to twenty-five billions. He and his associates,
too, partake of this fierce American spirit, in the sense
that they are strong individualists. And they are captains
of a peculiar industry.</p>

<p>The fathers foresaw this danger to the republic. Judah
Hammond says that Washington, before the close of his
second term, "rebuked self-creative societies from an apprehension
that their ultimate tendency would be hostile
to the public tranquillity." The members of the Society
of Tammany, who were then celebrating its eighth birthday,
"supposed their institution to be included in the reproof,
and they almost all forsook it." But the organization's
founder, William Mooney, and a few with him, made
Aaron Burr their leader, and he and his friend Matthew
L. Davis forged it and tempered it into an instrument of
perpetual and public plunder.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that there should be "self-creative
societies" in the United States devoted to the political
preferment and personal emolument of their members. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
accorded with the genius of a people who wished, above
all things, individually to be let alone in their lives, liberty,
and pursuit of happiness. Vast natural possessions must
be explored and exploited. The victorious new nation was
engaged in ravaging a bountiful land and in despoiling its
savage possessors. To the spirit of liberty which its citizens
inherited as Englishmen and as sons of dissidence
and protestantism, was added a contagion of wildness
from their redskin foes. The "Burrites" paraded in Indian
garb, danced, and used savage ceremonies. The
climate, changeable and stimulating, and the conditions
of the time, charged with the possibilities of material and
political conquest, had bred desperate leaders differing
from the patriots who headed the societies of the Revolution.
These leaders naturally opposed the party of
Alexander Hamilton, with its suggestions of a responsible,
centralized, and controlling government. The Society of
old Tamenund welcomed Aaron Burr into its wigwam
after he slew Hamilton. It shielded its founder, Mooney,
after he was convicted for stealing "wampum," or "trifles
for Mrs. Mooney," from New York City's supplies. It
acclaimed Benjamin Romaine as its Grand Sachem, after
his removal in 1806 from the City Controllership for malfeasance.
Abraham Stagg, political ancestor of Charles
F. Murphy, continued to get the contracts for paving the
city's streets after his conviction, in 1808, of concealing
accounts as Collector of Assessments. Tammany's braves
assaulted the City Hall in 1815 and removed the Mayor,
DeWitt Clinton, who was the honest and better prototype
of William Sulzer; but Clinton later repelled their attack
on him as Governor. Under Matthew Davis they had
early perfected their mode of raiding the primaries that
they might consequently raid the City Treasury, and in
1800 their manipulations actually resulted in the election
of President Jefferson. Their councils were so crafty that
by 1816 they were ruling New York by a committee of
fourteen chieftains. In his excellent history of Tammany
Hall, Gustavus Myers says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Substantially, fourteen men were acting for over five thousand
Republican voters, and eight members of the fourteen composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
a majority. Yet the system had all the pretence of a pure
democracy; the wards were called upon to elect delegates; the
latter chose candidates and made party rules; and the "great
popular meeting" accepted or rejected nominees; it all seemed
to spring directly from the people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus early was formed the perfect and predatory "system"
which typifies the oligarchies that have acquired
control of the American states and cities. Their forays and
assaults have been continuous through more than a century.
Now and then a warrior, chief, or Sachem has been
captured with his booty and punished. Such were the
cases of the treasury stealings by Ruggles Hubbard and
John L. Broome in 1817; of Jacob Barker and his fellow
Sachems in the bank frauds of 1826; of the procurement of
legislative charters by bribery in 1834, involving Peter
Betts and Luke Metcalfe; of the lobbying by Samuel
Swartout for the Harlem Railroad in 1835, and his defalcations
in 1838; of the Manhattan Bank's lendings to
Tammany leaders in 1840; of the gambler Rynders and
the Empire Club scandal in 1844; of the sales of nominations
under Fernando Wood in 1846, and the Council of
the "Forty Thieves" in 1851; of the extortions for ferry
leases and railroad franchises in 1854; of the election
frauds of 1857, and so on, down to the monumental thieveries
of "Boss" Tweed and his "ring," exposed in 1871,
the death of "Honest" John Kelly in 1886, the rise of
Richard Croker in 1890, who testified that he worked "for
his pocket all the time," and to Murphy, who in 1913 displayed
the supreme power of Tammany by bringing about
the removal of William Sulzer from the Governorship for
disobeying the "invisible government." These exposures
merely punctuate a long history of sustained and systematic
plunder, for a parallel with which we must go back
to the times of the Medici and the oligarchy they reared
above the fabric of the Florentine republic.</p>

<p>But the rule of thieves, corruptionists, and "machine"
men, which must be acknowledged as nearly universal in
the United States, a rule which makes it impossible for the
people to select their own candidates for office, and usually
dictates the elections, is strangely the price the public pays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for social and economic freedom. It was the intent of the
founders that the people should control their own government.
The founders made it as nearly a pure democracy
as they dared. The charters of American cities and the
constitutions of the states reveal long lists of elective
offices. The statutes define strictly the duties of officials;
their terms are made short, and through the multitude of
offices, important and petty, it is clear that one purpose
runs to make each directly answerable to the voters. In
every quadrennial cycle the voters of New York City engage
in the election of over five hundred incumbents of
offices, state and municipal. Tickets with candidates for
thirty offices in a single election are of normal length, and
between the rival candidates on four or five such tickets
each voter is expected intelligently to make his selection.
If he makes it intelligently, the officials elected will be
fit; if he understands their duties, and can spare time to
watch their conduct while he observes the behavior of
several score other officials whose terms have not yet expired,
he can punish those who are unfaithful, and reward
those who show themselves worthy of public trust.
But to carry on an efficient government in this way, most
of the voters would have to leave their private pursuits,
abandon the opportunities of a great and rich country,
and give their minds chiefly to the complex administrations
of all the public offices. Will they do it? Can they?</p>

<p>The voters, the least and most intelligent of them, all
know that it is impracticable to leave their private pursuits,
to which they devote time and energy unsparingly,
and attend in this way to the government. The very
method the people have provided to secure the offices
under their direct control defeats its purpose by the
amount of work and study it entails. No owner of a large
business establishment would pretend that he could judge
the qualifications of <i>all</i> his employees and know their work,
yet this ability to assure good service in the great business
establishment of government, is presumed in every voter.
The presumption is as distinguished for its foolishness as
for its age. It has not been well founded in a century,
during which time it has been repeatedly proved false.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Most elections go by default. Excepting in the cases of a
few conspicuous candidates, about whom the public can
make itself informed, and in small communities where
everyone knows his neighbor and the men in petty offices,
the electorate obeys mechanically the dictates of political
leaders.</p>

<p>The notion of having most offices elective, originated,
of course, in the practice of the old New England town
meetings. But as the towns grew into cities, and these
increased in population, the public works expanded, public
interests and activities became complex, and the number
of offices and instruments of government was multiplied,
each with its peculiar responsibilities. The private
concerns of the voters, likewise, acquired a complexity
that made extra demands on their attention, and the trades
and professions became specialized. The people could no
longer rule themselves by any method resembling that of
the town meeting. As they developed their unexampled
opportunities, their eyes were diverted from the multitude
of public offices, and the plunderers came in.</p>

<p>The politicians were devoted. They dedicated the time
the voters could not spare to holding together the complicated
public machinery. The people could not very
well go to the primaries; that should be the business of the
bosses, their bread and butter. They do their work at
least zealously. They are called traitors and plunderers,
many hate them, but perforce everybody tolerates them,
and the states and cities under the present system cannot
do without them. Their low organizations, their dives and
groggeries, their gangs of "floaters" and intimidators of
voters, their levyings of tribute, their control of men in
high places, their sales of power and patronage, and their
gigantic thefts and corruption show only in its perverse
working that fierce individualistic spirit which is in freer
play here and now among all ranks of men, and in all pursuits,
than elsewhere in the world during the course of
human history.</p>

<p>To say that the influence of such men, self-constituted
governors of the public for their own private interest, has
been pernicious beyond their immediate stealings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"honest graft," would be saying too little. The people in
their local governments, which are closer to their lives
and in the aggregate more important than the national
government, have not had the equal protection of the
laws. Under the bosses, legislatures were for sale, and
sold. The corporations got their public franchises by
bribery. Vast insurance funds were juggled in speculation.
The necessaries of life were monopolized. Wholesale adulteration
of foods and medicines was permitted. Refrigerated
meats were kept for higher prices until ptomaines
were produced. Unsafe buildings were erected. The
boss, in whose power was the enforcement of laws, could
instruct the aldermen or the legislators not to appropriate
money for their enforcement. He could bargain for the
passage of unwise or oppressive statutes, and he could instruct
judges, appointed to their candidacies by him, how
to interpret them. Had his influence extended only to
the heads of lawless trusts, it might have been less dangerous
than it was and is. But it was pervasive, it infected
the common people. They saw the laws unequally
administered, and a general contempt for law was bred.
Dr. Fritz Reichmann, Superintendent of Weights and
Measures at Albany, recently calculated that petty tradesmen
cheated New York's consumers with short measures
by at least $10,000,000 yearly. Raids upon the small
groceries and shops of Greater New York during a reform
administration, disclosed false weights and measures in
the majority of them. Here was evidence that the fabric
of the body politic had been warped and wrenched from
the standards of individual rectitude.</p>

<p>Fortunately, signs are not lacking of what has been
called a great moral awakening. Taking advantage of the
Federal system at Washington, which is based upon the
theory that the boss shall be selected by the people and
placed in the Presidency by them, appointing heads of all
the subordinate offices, the people have through the Presidents
caused the dissolution of great monopolies, and have
made the business of captaining industries by unfair
means disreputable. The industrial captains are no longer
satisfied with their material gains. They want the respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of their fellows. They are reforming their bad companies
or forsaking them, and are devoting their wealth to public
ends. One of the states has greatly aided in this change,
and its example is instructive. New Jersey, the "home of
the trusts," notorious throughout the world for its fathering
of monopolies, is in all but its legislature a "short
ballot" state. The legislators are elected at large by
counties; the ballot is long in the thickly populated urban
counties, and the unfair representation of the rural counties
unites with the city bosses to control the law-making
power, usually, also, dictating the nominations for Governor.
But the Governorship of New Jersey is practically
the only office to be filled by the people's vote. Like the
President at Washington the Governor appoints his own
cabinet and the rest of the state's executive and judicial
officers. New Jersey's pre-eminence as the home of the
trusts was gained after the nomination of Governor after
Governor by the bosses.</p>

<p>In the Fall of 1910 New Jersey's bosses overreached
themselves. Ex-Senator James Smith and his nephew
"Jim" Nugent, chairman of the Democratic State Committee,
saw an opportunity to defeat the Republicans,
who were in power, by the nomination of Woodrow Wilson,
then President of Princeton University. The New Jersey
Democracy adopted a platform which bore the impress of
Mr. Wilson's style and principles, and it gave to a great citizen
a great opportunity for service. He at once proclaimed
his independence of his political creators. He said
that if elected Governor he would act as leader of his
party. He became, in fact, a leader among many able
Governors in a series of harmonious reforms for which the
inspiration came from within the States. But ex-Governor
Pennypacker of Pennsylvania, who was a creature of the
boss system, accused Mr. Wilson of becoming the "most
arrogant boss of them all when he got to be Governor."
James Smith, shorn of his power, remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>New Jersey is unlike any other State in the Union. It elects
very few of its officials. Nearly all of them are named by the
Governor. He has about two hundred appointees, whose salaries
range from $2,000 to $15,000 a year. Among these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
appointees are Judges, and other places that carry a great deal of
influence with them. The method gives the Governor a chance
to build up a system&mdash;which is something which I believe I
was charged with having, and of which I have recently been
deprived.</p></blockquote>

<p>No more significant utterance had been made in a century
of American politics. Governor Wilson rose immediately
to the full stature of his powers. He carried out
his platform pledges, appealing to public opinion in the
passage through a hostile legislature of laws reforming the
conduct of elections, making employers liable for the injuries
of workmen, restricting campaign expenses and requiring
that they be published before elections, creating a
public utilities commission, regulating the cold storage of
foods, permitting cities to adopt governments by the short
ballot, and preventing the grant of charters to monopolistic
companies. He drove through a body of reform legislation
such as had never been seen on New Jersey's statute
books, eclipsing the record of a generation. He defeated
Boss Smith's candidacy for re-election to the United States
Senate, both because he was a boss and because as one of
the "Senators from Havemeyer" in 1894, Smith had betrayed
the principles of the Wilson tariff bill and President
Cleveland's program for tariff reduction. Wilson became
a "veto Governor," disposing of 150 bills invading home
rule, or reckless of debts, which were dumped on him in
the closing days of his first legislative session, and which
were carelessly drawn. And he fulfilled his pledge to comply
with the Civil Service rules in making all appointments.
His acceptance of the National Democratic
nomination to the Presidency in 1912 resulted in his becoming
the head of a "short ballot" nation.</p>

<p>President Wilson, like many of his predecessors at the
National capital, is vindicating the principle of the short
ballot. The state bosses have often invaded the Federal
legislature and government, but in comparison with their
control of state machines they have never got very far.
The national party machines are made up of local fragments.
But their nominating machinery, which has such
an inevitable and disastrous influence on local elections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
is concentrated upon the three offices of President, Senator,
and Representative, all of which are of primary concern
to the voters. The national candidates must conform
to higher standards than local candidates, because they are
few, conspicuous, and known of all their constituencies. In
this fact may be seen the controlling reason why, while
the local governments have everywhere been taken by the
bosses from the hands of the people, the Federal system is
still theirs.</p>

<p>Despite the brilliant and recent example of New Jersey,
handicapped as she is by a long-ballot legislature organized
on the bi-cameral principle, and despite the continuing
example of successive administrations at Washington, it is
nevertheless hard for the alarmed electorates of the states
to give up their old direct-election, town-meeting ideals.
The representative system has failed, they say. They
should see that it has failed because of its weight of
machinery, necessitated by the number of elective offices.
But the tendency is marked toward discarding the representative
principle at the primaries, and making it the
duty of the people to nominate as well as elect directly to
the many offices. That adds to the work of each voter,
which is already, and confessedly, too great. Tear down
representative government; away with the system of electing
delegates at the primaries; let us nominate as well as
vote for each candidate ourselves&mdash;that is the principle
of the direct primary bills which have acquired the force of
statutes in the western states, and are being agitated in
the east. It is but natural that the people should be enraged
at the manipulation of primaries by the politicians.
To do away with delegates and conventions is their first
impulse. Certainly the delegates elected, and the conventions
held, are injurious to good government. But the
principle of representation by the best qualified men of the
electorate is not impaired. The establishment of the direct
primary makes necessary two campaigns instead of one,
necessitates a new equipment of political machinery, and
doubles the distraction of the people by the many offices
they must fill. They do not yet see that fewer and more
responsible offices would bring abler candidates into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
field, that public opinion might be concentrated upon their
choosing by delegates in conventions, and on their intelligent
election at the polls.</p>

<p>The constitutional amendment submitted last Fall to the
voters of Ohio, providing fewer elective offices and centering
in the Executive the power of appointment to all
lesser posts, was opposed on the ground that it would take
authority from the people. Governor Cox was accused of
trying to be king. He might well have pointed to Washington,
which has had its "kingship" since the foundation
of the republic. Governor Glynn of New York, who
needed advice and counsel after the impeached Sulzer left
the capitol, held cabinet meetings with the Secretary of
State, the Attorney-General, Comptroller, State Treasurer,
and State Engineer and Surveyor. Unlike President
Wilson's cabinet, these men had been appointed, not by
the Chief Executive, but by the party machines, whose
leaders foresaw that they would be voted blindly into
office. Officials whom the public did not know had the
spending of millions in party patronage. To them the
new Governor was constrained to look for support. In
theory the Chief Executive, he had to work through agents
who might be hostile to his purposes. Through such
officers Mr. Murphy had extended his power throughout
the state, and his contractors were beneficiaries of the
millions wasted upon ill-constructed highways and
canals.</p>

<p>How to dispense with the cumbersome political machinery
that has oppressed the local elections as the needs of
the increasing population became more complex, is a chief
problem of these times. The bosses have, indeed, prepared
the way for its solution. It is necessary for the people to
recognize that the bosses' unofficial work should be placed
in the hands of responsible executive officials, and thus
changed from its private ends to public uses. The unskilled
committees of citizens formed during times of public
agitation and revolt may occasionally defeat the machines
of more skilled politicians, but their triumphs are
short-lived, and the reform administrations are often unsatisfactory.
Public spirit abounds, it grapples with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
enormous difficulties. The chief difficulty now is in a lack
of apprehension of the chief source of the public's troubles.</p>

<p>The smaller cities are leading in the fundamental reform.
Nearly three hundred of them have adopted the
short ballot in charters that confer government by commission.
Each of the commissioners, usually five in
number, focuses public attention on his headship of a
municipal department, and the five make most or all of
the appointments. The states, likewise, are beginning to
follow the lead of New Jersey. Ohio has granted its cities
the option of government by commissioners, and has
started to prune the list of state elective offices. California
is heading in the same direction, for it has made appointive
its state printer, three railroad commissioners, and clerk
of the supreme court. In New York it is sought to make
the Governor's "cabinet" appointive, as well as the state
judiciary, which compares ill with the judiciary of other
states, such as New Jersey and Massachusetts, where the
judges are appointed by the Governor. The Supreme
Court of the United States, whose judges are appointed
by the President for life, has won the respect of high
juridical authorities for its ability, probity, and learning,
in which it endures comparison with the greatest European
courts of last resort. A reduction of the legislatures into
single bodies has been advocated, notably by Governor
Hodges of Kansas. The legislatures with two chambers
have not worked to the ends of deliberation, but the contrary.
The progress of measures has been obscured in
them until the closing days of their sessions, when there
are "jammed through" questionable acts that have never
met the public gaze until their enactment. New York has
its legislative members apportioned by districts, which, if
reduced to fifty for a single chamber, would be approved
by advocates of the short ballot. Deliberation might then
be had by requiring a certain interval of time between introduction
of bills and their final passage, after revision
by skilled drafters. The county governments, also, need
overhauling, relegating the sheriffs, county clerks, registers,
surrogates, and district attorneys to the appointive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
lists. As for the cities, the tendency is to fix responsibility
in the Mayor or a commission.</p>

<p>The multiplied elective offices have come by evolution.
As the needs of the body politic increased more of them
were created, with developed and specialized functions.
They were made elective because the people were jealous
of their own control, anxious to select their representatives,
and to make them responsive to their will. The people
are now more eager and persistent in their purpose of
having a really representative government than at any
previous time in the national history. They occasionally
seize control of their complex machinery, and for a time
succeed in running it. But they are beginning to see that
the levers they throw must be fewer, though more powerful.
Gradually, by the reluctant assent of legislatures
submitting to the force of public opinion well led, or more
rapidly and comprehensively in constitutional conventions
guided by the enlightened and patriotic wills of public-spirited
revisers, the change to a government of a few
elected executives with large appointive powers will be
wrought. The unchartered freedom of the private oligarchies
will yield to the restraints imposed by the people
through their instructed heads.</p>

<h2>OUR TOBACCO: ITS COST<br />

<small>A TENTATIVE BALANCE SHEET</small></h2>


<p>The erudite Dr. Burton in his <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>
refers to the plant nicotiana as "divine, rare,
superexcellent tobacco which goes far beyond all the
panaceas, potable gold, and philosophers' stones." It
is the purpose of this article to study the social cost and
the social advantage of this divine commodity in the
United States, for the purpose of framing a rough and
necessarily incomplete balance sheet, which will bring
into juxtaposition the credit and the debit items. Such a
balance sheet can obviously not aspire to accuracy in
every detail. Many items cannot be expressed in figures
at all. For those which can be translated into dollars and
cents we cannot always get perfectly reliable statistics.
In many cases we must resort to estimates. Fortunately
the most important data are those for which the figures
are most trustworthy, and, as regards the others, it will
not be altogether fruitless to enumerate them, even
though we may not be able to give their value in legal
tender.</p>


<h3><i>Dr.</i></h3>

<p>1. The importance of tobacco in our national budget is
shown by the latest census figures, according to which it
ranks eleventh among the industries of the country, with
respect to the value of the product. Our manufactured
tobacco was worth at the factory in 1909, $416,695,000.
It thus outranked bread and other bakery products,
women's clothing, copper, malt liquors, automobiles,
petroleum, and distilled liquors. It was but about a third
less important than manufactures of cotton. Its value
was more than twice as great as that of distilled liquors.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
These figures do not, of course, tell us how much the people
now spend on tobacco. They represent the value
of the product at the factory four years ago. They do not
include such items as transportation, middlemen's profit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
advertising, etc., which enter into the retail price. Nor
do they include the large amount spent upon imported
tobacco.</p>

<p>A careful statistician, Professor William B. Bailey, of
Yale, published, nearly two years ago, some figures showing
that the people of the United States spent at that
time in a single year about $1,100,000,000 on tobacco.
As the receipts from the internal revenue tax on tobacco
have increased by about fourteen per cent. in the last two
years, it seems fair to assume that the general consumption
has increased by this amount. Fourteen per cent.
of $1,100,000,000 would be $154,000,000. It seems,
therefore, conservative to state that at the present time
the people are spending at least $1,200,000,000 for the
pleasure of smoking and chewing. As a check upon these
figures, the author has made two independent estimates
each by a different process, and their results confirm the
figures given above. It should be noted, moreover, that
this estimate applies only to the direct purchase of tobacco.
It does not include the accessories of smoking, such as
matches, pipes, receptacles for holding tobacco, cuspidors,
etc. In the fiscal year 1911-12, we imported pipes and
smokers' articles valued at $1,478,000, in addition to
what we produced at home. The difficulty of securing
estimates on these accessories is so great that no attempt
has been made to include them. If they could be included,
the amount which tobacco users spend for their
particular pleasure would undoubtedly foot up a great
deal more than $1,200,000,000 a year at the present time.</p>

<p>The significance of these figures can best be appreciated,
if we compare them with other items in our national
budget. To put the matter concretely, "tobacco takers"
spend in a single year twice the amount spent by the
entire country on railroad travel<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and about three times
the amount which it spends on its common school system;
they pay out annually about three times the entire cost
of the Panama Canal; they destroy directly about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
times as much property as was destroyed in the San Francisco
earthquake. Their smokes and chews cost them
just about twice what it costs to maintain the government
of the United States, including the interest on the
public debt. Our smokers could in a year and a half pay
off the entire bonded debt of our states, cities, and counties,
as it was in 1902, and in an additional nine months
the entire interest-bearing debt of the United States, if
they were willing to exercise the self-denial which was
exercised a few years ago by the Persian people.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Here are also a few comparisons with foreign countries.
A well-known international jurist not long ago put together,
as an argument against war, the figures showing
the expenditure of the leading nations of the world on
their army and navy. The list included Germany, Russia,
France, Great Britain, and Japan. The figures for 1910
footed up $1,217,000,000 or approximately the amount
devoted to tobacco by the people of the United States in a
single year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Our smokers impose upon the resources of
the country a burden larger than the war indemnity which
Germany exacted of France after a humiliating defeat in
1871; they spend about six times what it costs the German
Empire to maintain its elaborate and comprehensive
system of workingmen's insurance.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>2. The cost of smoking to the country is by no means
limited to its costs to the smoker. Chief among its indirect
burdens is the incineration of property other than
tobacco leaves, and the destruction of innocent lives which
it exacts as its annual toll from non-smokers. We have
had some tragic illustrations of this in recent years. The
Triangle shirtwaist fire in New York City in 1910 not only
burned up valuable property but caused a cruel loss of
life. Over one hundred and forty workers were sacrificed
in this case to a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>In the winter of 1912 occurred the destruction of the
Equitable Building, "caused by the careless tossing of a
match into a waste paper basket in the Savarin restaurant
which occupied quarters in the basement. This match
had doubtless been used to light a cigar or cigarette."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The waste of time caused by this fire in addition to the
actual destruction of the structure must have been enormous,
if one thinks of the loss of the records of the great
corporations which occupied the building, and of the inconvenience
and delays suffered by stockholders and policy
holders and other persons who had business relations with
them. The fire which destroyed a part of the state capitol
at Albany, including a vast number of books and manuscripts,
was in all probability caused by a smoker, though
the evidence is not quite as conclusive as in the case of
the Triangle shirtwaist factory and the Equitable Building.
Powell Evans says regarding this fire: "The financial
loss is $6,000,000. The loss of documents and records is
priceless." And yet to estimate the total social loss we
should add to the pecuniary value of the building and its
contents, the waste of time and labor inflicted upon a
large number of innocent students who desired to use the
library, but were unable to do so. All of the readers of
the summary of legislation, e. g., were seriously embarrassed,
since this fire delayed the issue of this publication
by a couple of years.</p>

<p>These cases are referred to, because they were peculiarly
dramatic and are still fresh in the memory of newspaper
readers. But it would be a mistake to assume that they
represent anything exceptional or phenomenal, like an
earthquake or a tornado. Smoking is a chronic and regular
cause of fires, perfectly familiar to those whose profession
requires them to risk their lives in fighting them, a cause
as susceptible of statistical treatment as the mortality from
tuberculosis or typhoid. Unfortunately our statistics on
this subject are very meagre, and efforts to secure figures
from insurance men, who would be expected to have a
direct interest in ascertaining the facts, have been surprisingly
discouraging. Through the prompt courtesy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the officials concerned, however, the reports of several
state fire marshals and of the fire commissioners of several
large cities have been secured, and are summarized below.</p>

<p>These statistics make no claim to completeness. In
the nature of things, the causes of many fires cannot be
ascertained, and, even where they are stated in a printed
report, they are not always easy to interpret. For the
particular subject under discussion it is especially hard
to know what percentage of the fires caused by carelessness
with matches should be charged to smokers. The common
use of electric lights in cities, as well as of permanent
fires for cooking and heating, makes it altogether reasonable
to suppose that a very large percentage of the matches
used serve the purposes of smokers. Observation of the
habits of smokers indicates that a still larger percentage
of fires caused by the careless use of matches is attributable
to them. To avoid exaggeration, however, it has been
thought best not to assume that all of the fires caused by
carelessness with matches should be charged to smokers.
Hence two columns are printed, one showing the fires due
to matches (exclusive of matches in the hands of children
and matches supposed to be ignited by rats or mice), the
other showing the fires which are caused directly by cigars,
cigarette stumps, smoking in bed, etc. The column giving
the total number of fires for which causes are assigned is
made by deducting from the total number of fire alarms
the cases of false alarms, double alarms, etc., and the cases
in which the cause was either not ascertained, or so vaguely
stated as to be meaningless.</p>

<p>It would be futile with our present knowledge to try
to construct any general average showing what percentage
of fires in the country at large can fairly be charged to
smokers. In some of the western states and cities in particular,
the records are obviously incomplete as in the
report of the state fire marshal of Illinois, which gives less
than half as many fires for the city of Chicago during the
year 1912 as were reported by the city fire marshal for
the same period. And it is only fair to say that in some of
these western sections of the country the percentage is
much smaller than in the cities given above. One fact is,
however, incontestable, and that is that smokers are
recognized in all of the reports received as at least one of
the important causes of fires and are sometimes, as in
New York City, the most important single cause. This
is clearly shown in the following extract from the report
of the fire department for the year 1912:</p>

<p>It also seems safe to say that in the large cities of the
East, where it may be assumed that the records are more
accurate than in the country at large, the percentages
agree closely enough to justify the estimate made by Fire
Commissioner Johnson of New York City that 15 to 20%
of our fires are caused by the careless throwing away of
lighted matches, cigars and cigarettes.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The late chief of the fire department of New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Mr. E. F. Croker, writes: "I am certain that an examination
of the fire losses in our cities and towns, the loss of
life as well as property, which has been caused by the
cigarette habit would be found appalling. The paper and
light tobacco used in cigarettes holds fire for some time,
usually until the entire remnant which has been thrown
away has been consumed. The majority of cigarette
smokers are careless in the disposition of these remnants,
and usually throw or drop them wherever they may be."
So great is the menace of the smoker to property and life
that New York has passed a law forbidding smoking in
factories. Under this law, as interpreted by the corporation
counsel, "the smoking of a pipe, cigar or cigarette
in or about a factory using or containing inflammable
material, is a public nuisance within the meaning of Section
1530 of the Penal Law, which provides: 'a public
nuisance is a crime against the order and economy of the
State,'" etc.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The figures of fire losses given above apply to cities
and dwellings. But tobacco is also the cause of many
forest fires. The state forester of Massachusetts estimates
that smokers are responsible for more forest fires in that
state than any other single agency. The number which
could be directly and positively traced to them in the
single year 1908 was 111, involving a loss of $33,000. But
it is clear that it is peculiarly difficult to trace the causes
of forest fires on account of the fact that smokers
throw down their matches or cigarette stubs, or cigar
stubs, and pass on, quite unconscious of the damage which
follows in their wake. "That the careless smoker, who
persists in the habit when in woodlands or traversing the
country during a dry time, whether at work or play, is
the greatest menace to future forestry, it is believed there
is little question."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In Connecticut the state forester reports that, out of
116 fires, of which the cause was ascertained in 1912, 25
were due to smokers. Regarding the 58 fires attributed
to "Fishermen," "Hunters," "Matches," and "Strollers,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
he says: "It is evident that most of these fires were due
to carelessness in handling matches, throwing down cigar
butts, etc., or leaving fires unextinguished."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The loss
of life due to smokers' fire must be enormous, but this is all
that can be safely said in the absence of reliable statistics.</p>

<p>The responsibility of the smoker is not limited to the
destruction of property and of life. If he causes a certain
percentage of fires, he must also be held accountable for
his share of the cost of maintaining our fire departments,
of the injuries suffered by firemen in performing their
duties, of the cost of fire prevention, and of the cost of
insurance.</p>

<p>A careful report made by the United States Geological
Survey a few years ago estimated the annual loss and expense
due to fires in the United States in the year 1907, including
fire protection and insurance, as over $456,000,000.
If smokers cause but 10% of this they cost us $45,000,000
under this item alone. If they cause 20%, as they obviously
do in some places and as they are estimated to
do by Commissioner Johnson, the cost under this item is
$90,000,000, and the figures have undoubtedly increased
since the government report was made six years ago.</p>

<p>3. In studying the effect of any expenditure upon
society, we must take into account the diversion of social
activity from one line of production to another. The
consumer is the ultimate director of national production.
If he elects to drink whiskey, instead of buying bread for
his children, this means that the country produces more
whiskey and less bread. If rich men elect to take large
tracts of arable land for game preserves, they prevent
that land from being used to raise food for the people.
Likewise, if smokers elect to spend a certain part of their
income upon tobacco, they determine that a certain area
of land shall be devoted to the cultivation of this plant,
which would otherwise be devoted to the cultivation of
vegetables, or to dairy farming, or to raising whatever
commodities their money would otherwise have been
spent for. The amount of land thus preëmpted for the preserves
of tobacco users in the United States is very large.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
It amounted in 1912 to no less than 1,225,800 acres or
over one-sixth of the area devoted to raising vegetables.
The value of the tobacco product was $104,302,856, or
one-quarter of the value of all vegetables including potatoes.
This must play no small part in maintaining the
high cost of living in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Tobacco culture,
moreover, tends, as is well known, to exhaust the soil
and thus to rob future generations, unless fertility is artificially
maintained at great expense.</p>

<p>4. The demands made by smokers upon public conveyances
increase materially the capital required to equip
railroads and other means of communication. Smokers
are never charged an extra fare for the inconvenience and
expense which they cause, although special cars or parts
of cars are provided for their use. On some of the smaller
railroads, where the traffic is light and a single car would
be ample to carry all of the passengers desiring to take a
certain train, the train regularly includes a smoking car,
thus adding 100 per cent. to the car accommodations required
without adding to revenue. On the more crowded
trains and on roads with heavier traffic, the space wasted
is naturally not so great. But there is always some additional
investment required, for which the railroads get
no return. There were 47,095 passenger cars in the United
States in 1910. Assuming that only 10% are for smokers,
4,709 cars are necessitated by the smoking habit; assuming
an average cost of $15,000 per car, over $71,000,000
of capital, on which interest and depreciation have to be
charged, must be invested, in order to serve smokers. And
yet smokers are treated in our parlor cars as a privileged
class, for, while ordinary travellers are entitled to but
one seat, smokers get two seats for one ticket. Not infrequently
a smoker will engage a seat in a parlor car and
leave it empty during the greater part of his trip. He
uses the additional seat provided gratuitously for him in
the smoking section of the car, or in a special smoking car,
while a delicate woman or an invalid, who fain would occupy
and gladly pay for his seat, is debarred from doing so.</p>

<p>5. The cost of keeping the world clean must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
enormously enhanced by smokers, though there is no political
arithmetic which will give us any figures on the subject.
Anyone who will take but a casual glance at the floors of
railway stations, smoking cars, hotels, clubs, and other
places of public resort will realize how much disagreeable
work in the way of cleaning up the smoker forces society
to do for him.</p>

<p>6. The effect of tobacco upon the health is an important
item in the cost of the habit to the country, though one
which can obviously not be expressed in figures. Dr. von
Frankl Hochwart, the eminent nerve specialist, has written
an article dealing only with the nervous diseases of
smokers, and though this paper was read at a meeting
of neurologists and eight physicians took part in the discussion,
not one of them expressed dissent on any essential
point.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This distinguished authority based his statements on
the study of 1,500 of his own patients who were heavy
nicotinists. After eliminating all of the other poisons or
diseases which might have affected these cases, he reached
the general conclusion that, among smokers in general,
about one-third complained of troubles which they attributed
to tobacco. These symptoms were particularly
strong in the case of heavy smokers, of whom half showed
bad effects, lasting sometimes for a considerable time.
The troubles were especially noticeable in the case of
cigarette smokers. The most common complaints were
palpitation of the heart and general nervousness, but a
large number of other nervous affections were diagnosed
as specifically attributable to nicotine, such as loss of
memory, meningitis, aphasia, deafness, and dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Particularly striking was the unconscious evidence
which was given to the public at the time of the attack
upon the life of Ex-President Roosevelt in October, 1912,
when his physicians used the following expression in a
public bulletin: "We find him in magnificent physical
condition due to his regular physical exercise, his habitual
abstinence from tobacco and liquor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The manufacture of tobacco is generally regarded as
an unhealthy occupation, and many assert that it tends
to produce miscarriage in the case of women.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Some,
like Sir Thomas Oliver, think the evidence on this point
not conclusive. But this eminent English authority holds
that tobacco is bad for the health of English soldiers and
speaks of it under the head of occupational diseases.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
"Tobacco especially," he says, "I believe to be a cause
of heart trouble among soldiers, though many authorities
doubt it. I have known a man who was anxious to be
invalided out of the army produce the most marked cardiac
symptoms by the surreptitious use of strong cake
tobacco." "Smokers' cancer" is a term familiar to physicians.
It is not necessary to discuss at length the effects
of tobacco on health in an article dealing mainly with the
economic and social phases of the question. Suffice it to
point out the fact of its harmfulness, leaving to physicians
the consideration of the mode and extent of nicotine morbidity.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>7. That tobacco is bad for the mental development of
children is so commonly conceded by teachers that the
Boy Scouts organization has as one of its main purposes
the discouragement of the cigarette habit among boys.
General Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the
Boy Scouts, is said to have gone through the campaign in
West Africa without smoking and to have escaped fever
when thousands of others were attacked by it.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
attitude of the Boy Scouts is seen in the following resolution,
passed November, 1912, by a large conference of
scout commissioners held in New York City: "Resolved,
That the local councils of the Boy Scouts of America recommend
that all scout masters and other officials while
in uniform or on duty refrain from the use of tobacco in
any form as being detrimental to the general aim of our
movement in the development of healthful habits of life
in the growing boy." In the state of Wisconsin, a movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
has been inaugurated to discountenance smoking on
the part of all persons, teachers or pupils, connected with
the high schools.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>8. That tobacco causes a considerable loss of time must
be obvious to anyone who has observed the habits of the
smoker. Not only is a certain amount of every day devoted
to this occupation, but personal experience shows
that this loss is not confined to those who smoke. It is
now a very common thing for people to smoke at committee
meetings, and it seems to the writer that the proceedings
always become slower and less brisk when the dope
of tobacco smoke fills the air.</p>

<p>9. Tobacco often seems to have a distinct effect in
weakening the social sense. This is a statement which
cannot be buttressed by statistics, but in such a matter
we can put a good deal of reliance on the testimony of
smokers whose prejudices would naturally be on the other
side. The editor of the <i>Outlook</i> says: "Of late years men
who smoke without any regard to the comfort of others
have so greatly increased in numbers that it is not surprising
that an organization has been formed to limit
smoking."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A more striking piece of evidence, because
obviously unconscious, is that which is given by a well-known
English author, Mr. G. K. Chesterton. A friend
of his had been dining with a man who was both a teetotaler
and a non-smoker. In relating the story he says:
"It ended with the guest asking the host if he might
smoke, and receiving a stern reply in the negative. My
friend (I am happy to say) immediately lit his pipe and
vanished in smoke. Having sufficiently and properly
perfumed all the curtains and carpets with smoke, he
purged the house of its smoker."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Note the parenthesis
"I am happy to say." Here is a well-known author
who is willing to publicly claim that it is proper and right
for a guest to knowingly and intentionally commit a
nuisance in his host's house in the matter of tobacco.
"Senatorial courtesy," dominant as it is in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
appointments to office, gives way before tobacco, and a
senator, whose health is seriously affected by tobacco
smoke, has appealed in vain to his fellow statesmen to
spare him this infliction in the executive sessions of the
senate.</p>

<p>The Triangle shirtwaist fire in New York made so
slight an impression on smokers, that, when in July, 1913,
the inspectors visited the same premises, they found the
elevator boy smoking a cigarette and the proprietor of a
factory in the same building smoking a cigar, in violation
of a law passed in consequence of this very fire. It would
be a mistake to regard the New York factory owners who
have recently been fined for violating the anti-smoking
law as peculiarly obtuse and unimaginative. They are
simply examples of the fact, familiar enough to non-smokers,
that the nicotine habit tends to make smokers
indifferent to the social effects of smoking. There is
nothing paradoxical in saying that a habit which is often
associated with sociability leads to anti-social conduct.
The same is true of the alcohol habit, the opium habit,
and indeed of all similar habits. Even the lady-like tea
habit may have anti-social effects, if it so dominates the
life that a person will neglect an engagement or a duty
rather than lose the pleasure of the afternoon cup.</p>

<p>10. That tobacco affects the will power, and therefore
national efficiency, was recognized years ago by the genial
"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," who said: "I think
self-narcotization and self-alcoholization are rather ignoble
substitutes for undisturbed self-consciousness and
an unfettered self-control."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And again he says, "I have
seen the green leaf of early promise grown brown before
its time, under such nicotian regimen, and thought the
umbered meerschaum dearly bought at the cost of a brain
enfeebled and a will enslaved."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>


<h3><i>Cr.</i></h3>

<p>Having now considered what tobacco costs the United
States let us endeavor to ascertain what it does for the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The first and most tangible item to be put on the
credit side is taxation. In the year 1911-12, the amount
paid by tobacco users towards the support of the government
was as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="amount paid by tobacco users">
<tr><td align="left">Internal revenue tax</td><td align="right">$70,590,151</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Customs duties</td><td align="right">25,572,000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">$96,162,151</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We may estimate the figures for 1912-13 as about
$105,000,000. Thus it is clear that the tobacco habit is a
means by which the government is able to secure a large
contribution, albeit an involuntary one, from the users.</p>

<p>2. The typical and commonly recognized advantage
of tobacco is in the satisfaction of a certain craving and
the production of a certain enjoyment which may be
briefly designated by the medical term euphoria. This
gratification is apparently not an entirely simple sensation,
if we may credit the testimony of smokers, nor is it
uniform in all persons. Some claim that tobacco quiets
the nerves and therefore makes them more peaceably
inclined, more ready to effect compromises in a dispute,
and altogether more sociable. Others on the other hand,
claim that it stimulates the mind and enables them to
do better intellectual work.</p>

<p>In all cases the effect is personal, not social, and the
evidence with regard to it is entirely subjective. Thus the
claim that tobacco stimulates a person's brain, rests upon
his own testimony. There is no reason to believe that the
effect of nicotine on literary output can be detected by
others, and the many cases in which smokers have deliberately
given up the habit and yet continued to do their
brain work with no diminution of effectiveness, create a
strong presumption against attaching much weight to the
subjective testimony on the subject. Equally indefinite
and even less susceptible of objective measurement is the
feeling of gratification or enjoyment which comes from
the taste of the weed, and the narcotic effect of the nicotine.
There is reason to suspect, however, that its comforting
effects are often exaggerated. In such a case we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
shall avoid a prejudiced opinion, if we take the testimony
of those whose interests favor the use of tobacco. The
following statement occurs in an advertisement distributed
by a tobacco company: "How have your cigars
tasted for the last two weeks? Haven't you a mouthful
of crumbled cigar now? Do you like a cigar that tasted
like a dried cornstalk? Do you enjoy having a cankered
tongue and a tender throat?" "You are smoking cigars,
aren't you? Your throat tickles, your head is 'swimmy'
in the morning, you have to steady your hand to sign a
check, your stenographer hates you and your wife breathes
a sigh of relief when you leave in the morning." This is
not from the tract of an anti-tobacco society, but reflects
unconsciously the opinion of the sellers of a certain brand
of Havana cigars regarding the effects produced by other
brands, in other words, by those which are in most common
use by persons who cannot afford the more expensive
grades. Indeed, it seems very probable that in many
cases smoking is done, not because of the real enjoyment
which comes from the practice, but because it has become
a habit which the nicotinist cannot break himself
of.</p>

<p>These facts point to the conclusion that while a part
of what tobacco users spend is contributed by them towards
the support of the government, and therefore
should be credited to their account, the only clear and
definite advantage is their euphoria, the purely subjective
feeling of satisfaction which is indefinite and vague, and
which there is reason to think is often exaggerated.</p>

<p>Our balance sheet, based upon this discussion might
thus be formulated as follows:</p>

<p>Smokers' Euphoria,</p>

<p>In this balance sheet the item <i>profit and loss</i> is intentionally
omitted. To include it would give this study the
form of an argument instead of the simple statement of
facts which it is intended to be. Every reader must,
therefore, decide for himself on which side of the account
the balance should be inserted, and doubtless many will
decide this question, as they decide so many other questions,
according to their personal inclinations. The
smoker will be convinced that the enjoyment which he
gets out of tobacco is worth all that the habit costs the
community. The non-smoker, on the other hand, will
feel that the non-smoking majority pay altogether too
much for the pleasure of the smoking minority. Neither
point of view interests the writer, and he will have spent
his time in vain, if he has not made it clear that he has
endeavored to construct a <i>social</i> balance sheet. The only
question to decide, therefore, is whether the value of
tobacco to society is worth what society pays for it in
direct expenditure as well as in the destruction of property,
lives, health, etc.</p>

<p>Certain other familiar topics are also omitted, not because
they are lacking in interest or importance, but
because the author believes in the maxim <i>ne sutor supra
crepidam</i> and, being an economist, has limited himself to
strictly economic and tangible topics. The field of ethics,
e. g., is not entered, though some of the social and economic
facts which are brought out may supply the moralist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
with useful data. Nor is the subject of manners considered,
though courtesy may be regarded, in the words of
an English statesman, as "a national asset." History
too, is untouched, though tobacco first led to the introduction
of slavery into Virginia and, therefore, has played
an important part in our political and social evolution.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the article is to give tobacco its
proper perspective. Many people, e. g., who are familiar
with the significance of our drink bill do not realize that
the amount annually spent on tobacco is about three-quarters
of the amount spent on intoxicating beverages
of all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The national war budget is always the subject
of much criticism, and yet the appropriations for our
army and navy are less than one-fourth what we spend
annually on tobacco. For years the power of the government
has been exerted to keep down the railroad rates,
until it is claimed that the roads cannot pay the wages
demanded by the men and give the public the service
which it expects without an increase in charges. And
yet an addition of but 25% to passenger fares would
mean but about one-eighth of what the tobacco users
spend without a thought, and would afford the railroads
a welcome relief.</p>

<p>In estimating any social burden, account must be taken
not only of its magnitude in a single year, but also of its
persistency. One peculiarity of the tobacco habit is that,
while it is often difficult to acquire, it is still more difficult
to shake off. Indeed, in most cases the will is as much
bound as if the smoker had signed, sealed, and delivered
a mortgage on his own personality. This is well understood
by the tobacco trust, which is giving away cigarettes
to the people of China in the confidence that, once the
habit has been acquired, the trust can collect its annual
tribute, almost as surely as if it had conquered the country
in war. Thus, it is not unfair to capitalize the annual
expenditure on tobacco and to say that our country carries
a direct interest charge of some $1,200,000,000 on a
social mortgage, of which about $105,000,000 is in favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the treasury, the balance in favor of the tobacco interests,
in addition to the heavy personal and social burdens
specified in our balance sheet. The direct charge
alone represents the interest at 5% on $24,000,000,000 or
over twenty-four times the interest-bearing public debt
of the United States. No wonder the tobacco dealers are
happy. And no wonder that shrewd old Dr. Burton,
after saying what he could in favor of tobacco, in the
words quoted at the beginning of this article, adds in
conclusion: "A good vomit, I confess, a virtuous herb,
if it be well qualified, opportunely taken, and medicinally
used; but as it is commonly abused by most men, which
take it as tinkers do ale, 'tis a plague, a mischief, a violent
purger of goods, lands, health, hellish, devilish and damned
tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul."</p>

<h2>OUR ALCOHOL: ITS USE</h2>


<p>It has long been more or less proverbial that Americans
cannot drink without getting drunk; and yet
the Americans are not counted an intemperate people,
because probably a smaller proportion of them drink than
of any other great nation. And it may not be altogether
fanciful to suggest that it is also because the word intemperate
is not applied to the absence of temperance in cases
where people do not drink at all. And yet, in etymology
and common sense, a man on the negative side of a temperate
use of alcohol is as intemperate as a man on the
positive side.</p>

<p>Those who deny that any use of alcohol is desirable run
counter to the vast preponderance of all recorded opinion
and sentiment&mdash;even as eloquently expressed in poetry
and song. They may nevertheless be right, as were those
who, not so long ago, were in the minority regarding war.
But this minority opposed a fact unescapable in the then
condition of human nature; and the present minority
regarding alcohol are opposing a fact unescapable in
the present condition of human nature. Whatever may
be best for the future, it is undeniable that at the present
time men will drink alcohol, and the only practical questions
concern the circumstances most apt to make their
drinking of it innocuous, and even beneficial, if there is any
warrant for the widespread and time-honored opinion that,
like every other thing claimed to be good, alcohol is good
only when used under certain circumstances and in certain
measure.</p>

<p>The temperance of the continental peoples, with their
light wines, is a commonplace. The English native supply
of alcoholic beverages is more like ours, and the
climatic conditions more, on the whole, like those of our
most thickly populated regions. Probably a much larger
proportion of the English people "drink" than of our
people, and they probably do it with results better, or at
worst, less disastrous than those to such of our people as
do it at all. A contrary impression, however, is widespread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in consequence of confusing England with Scotland.
But the conditions and the results are very different.</p>

<p>So are those of England as compared with ours, and it
may be well to compare the mood and manner of their
drinking with ours. Society must always frown upon the
morose and solitary drinker&mdash;the man who drinks merely
for the purpose of injecting alcohol into his system. Drinking
should be regarded only as a means, not as an end. It
is not good in and for itself; it is good only as an aid toward
loftier things. The great virtue of drinking, granting it
virtue, is that it may ease the perilous and delicate ascent
to human intercourse, or, to change the metaphor, alcohol
is the best of social lubricants. Other things equal, it
is easier to get acquainted with a man who does not scorn
the temperate wine, than with one who does. With the
latter, a ready element of mutuality is absent, and you
have to beat about for some simple and casual means of
give and take. But an incidental compotation, though it
is accused, not unjustly, of being dangerous to the
weak, to the normal and preponderant proportion of
humanity, serves as a letter of introduction; and "What
will you have?" is but the first question in that mystic
catechism which may lead to "What gifts of sympathy
and kindliness may we exchange?"</p>

<p>The justification for drinking of course asserts itself
most clearly at home around the hospitable board, or in
the comfortable corner of the club, where conversation is
paramount, and an occasional sip serves merely as a
comma or semi-colon in the talk. Under such ideal conditions,
wine eases the fluency of conversation, brightens the
wit, humanizes the humor, and mystically charms away
that native diffidence which is a bar to confidence and
sympathy. One does not readily deal lies to one's host at
dinner over a glass of wine; and our little shifts and poses,
our false evasions and our falser modesties, melt away to
the limbo of things forgotten when we exchange a friendly
high-ball at the club. But unfortunately a very small
proportion of the whole community can afford good wine
at dinner, and hardly a larger number can enjoy the
amenities of a club. For social drinking the vast majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of men must frequent the public bars, and adventure on a
chat with whoever is about. It follows that the atmosphere
of the public bars must exert an inevitable influence
over most of the men who drink at all. A man is moulded
by the clubs that he frequents; the public bar is the only
available club for the small tradesman and the manual
laborer, the homeless and the friendless and the poor; and
the great saloon-frequenting class must necessarily become
inoculated with the social tone of the saloons that they
frequent. If one reeks with foul language, its patrons will
become imbued with the habit of profanity; but if its atmosphere
be genial and genteel, its patrons will maintain,
or else adopt, the amenities of more graceful intercourse.
The social influence of the public bar is subtle and insinuating
in its effect upon the individual and unavoidable
in its effect upon the whole community; it may be an influence
for evil or for good; it may even ultimately save
or damn a nation. There arises from this circumstance a
weighty problem, which demands more careful consideration
from our sociologists than it has yet received.</p>

<p>The proposition, simply stated, is just this: Whatever
serves to lift the tone of social drinking serves strongly to
refine the nation; and whatever tends to debase the tone
of drinking in saloons and public-houses tends to degrade
the social atmosphere of the community at large. It
follows that one of the easiest and most effective ways to
clean up the slums of any of our cities would be to exercise
a sympathetic and paternal supervision over their saloons.
Some such idea as this was in the mind of the late Bishop
Potter of New York when he inaugurated the so-called
Subway Tavern.</p>

<p>At the present time the average American saloon, particularly
in our southern and middle western states, is a
vile place, and exerts a pernicious influence over the largest
class of the community. As a result, a strong movement
has been instituted to abolish the saloon. The
states that have adopted prohibition have done it not so
much with the idea that social drinking in itself is bad, as
with the idea that the average saloon is bad, and that prohibition
is the only means of undermining the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the average saloon. But might it not be wiser to realize
that the saloon might be made an instrument for good,
and not for evil, if, instead of being abolished, it should be
tactfully reformed? A decent and respectable saloon may
radiate decency and respectability throughout its neighborhood;
and men who learn to drink genially and temperately
with their fellows are not likely to descend to
vulgar rowdyism in other ways of intercourse, or, still
worse, to "booze" at home. After hours, many, probably
most, workingmen will drink; we surely have no
human right to decree that they shall not; but we may
exercise the human grace of helping them to drink socially
and decently instead of alone and vilely. At present the
rudeness of our average saloon spreads like a contagious
disease to the homes of all the men who breathe its evil
air. If we could make our saloons less vulgar and more
clubable, if we could lift the tone of public drinking among
our less fortunate classes, we should spread abroad a sense
of the amenities, a wholesome social feeling, and a glimmer
of the finer graces of gentility.</p>

<p>There is much virtue in this "if"; and it must not be
supposed that the condition it suggests is unattainable
except in the idle dreams of an idealist. We have before
us an example of precisely what we need, in the average
English public-house. The world-engirdling empery of
England is vested in the wholesomeness and sturdiness of
her middle and lower classes; and if you need evidence to
convince you that England is still dauntless and undefeatable
among the nations, you have only to observe
these classes in their clubs,&mdash;the ordinary English public
taverns. In Salisbury, for instance, there is a venerable
hostelry that is called the "Haunch of Venison." I do
not hesitate to advertise it by its actual name; for it deserves
and demands a visit from every American whose
interest in the solitary contemplation of cathedral architecture
has not made him forget that man is, first of all, a
social being. If he will proceed almost any evening to the
tiny smoking-room upon the second floor (ducking his
head beneath the mediæval rafters if he be above the middle
height), and will join casually in the conversation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the company he meets there, he will discover something
about the social possibilities of the public tavern that he
has never learned at home. The company consists of
small tradesmen of the town who have bolted up their
shutters and gathered for a genial glass or two of "bitter"
before resigning to the night. The talk deals earnestly
with politics; protection and free trade are weighed logically
one against the other, the measures of Mr. Lloyd-George
are discussed in the spirit more of the economist
than of the partisan, the German menace is given its
meed of attention, and the boy scout movement is explained
to the visitor from overseas. A round of drinks is
ordered quietly; and the American is asked about the
tariff and the growth of monopolies in his own country,
the rate of wages and the cost of living, and the policies of
Mr. Roosevelt. Then the visitor assumes the part of
host, and shifts the talk to English architecture, touching
upon old houses in the neighborhood, the timber rafters
of the room in which the company is gathered, the excavations
at Old Sarum, the mood of Stonehenge underneath
the setting sun, and the high-aspiring composition of the
great cathedral. The proprietor of the tavern has looked
in, spoken to nearly everybody by name, and offered another
round of drinks with the compliments of the house.
His charming wife joins the talk without embarrassment
to anyone, and becomes a sort of sister to the company.
So the evening proceeds, until at the closing hour of eleven
the company disperses with hand-shakings and good
wishes for the night.</p>

<p>And remember that this is a public-house, in the market-place
of a little city, open to anyone who wishes to spend
two-pence for a glass of ale. It is not a hotel; it is not
aristocratic; you will not find the name of it in Baedeker;
it is just an ordinary bar that gleams a welcome to the
lax-jointed laborer in the street. And the "Haunch of
Venison" at Salisbury is not to be considered as unique,
but is rather to be taken as typical of the English public-house.
In Canterbury, for example, there is a bar-room,
the name of which I dare not mention lest I increase unduly
the annual historic pilgrimage to that cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
capital; but I am willing to say for the benefit of future
American investigators that it may be entered either from
the Parade or from the little square adjacent to the ancient
gate of the cathedral precincts where the monument
to Marlowe is erected. From the main entrance, in the
Parade, you proceed through a bar-room to a cosy little
smoking-room beyond. There is a goodly company of
young clerks and salesmen and minor officials of the town,
interested in cricket, the growing of hops, the suffragette
movement, the state of business, and the proposals to
reform the House of Lords. But I have led you thither
mainly that you may meet the daughter of the proprietor,
who trips in with a tray of drinks and sandwiches.
She is a glowing girl of seventeen, exceedingly alive, pretty
and witty, jolly and jocose. She has rather an Italian
look, with black eyes and black and billowy hair, and is
dressed in the deep blue that Raphael loved. She knows
everyone by name, except yourself, to whom she is speedily
introduced. She greets you with a deft remark and a
delicious gurgle of young laughter. When she leaves the
room, it is as if Puck or Peter Pan had darted away to tree-tops.
You recall the harmony of her nicely modulated
speech and rich contralto laughter; and you are not surprised
when a young tradesman tells you that she has been
studying singing for eight months in London and is already
a favorite at local concerts. Again she romps into
the little room, and the sense of life enlarges. She has
brought her mother this time, who wishes to meet the newcomer
to that nightly company; and at once you are reminded
of Whitman's saying about women,&mdash;"The
young are beautiful: but the old are more beautiful than
the young." The mother reveals the same abundance of
essential energy, but softened, modulated, and matured.
Her face is a sweet memory of years that were: it has lost
that impudence of smiling and tossing the chin at what is
yet to be. But then the daughter laughs again and overwhelms
you with the joy of youth. And this is a place
that you came upon by chance, seeking a whiskey and
soda!... How different, how wonderfully different,
from the casual American saloon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The main reason for the difference in tone between the
American saloon and the English public-house is that the
latter is hallowed by the familiar presence of women. In
England the male bartender is practically unknown, and
drinks are served almost universally by bar-maids. It is
part of the inalienable birthright of women that they can
always set the social tone of any business that they engage
in, and without effort can compel the men with whom they
come in contact to ascend or to descend to meet them on
the level they have set. In New York, for instance, the
same man who is flippant with the manicure-lady is respectful
to the woman usher in the opera-house: instinctively,
and without conscious consideration, he meets any
business-woman in the mood that she expects of him. To
the women and not to the men is it granted to control the
tone of any association between the sexes: bad women can
debase a business, good women can uplift it, whereas the
men with whom they are engaged would of themselves be
powerless to lower or to elevate its tone. The way in
which stenographers and shop-girls are treated depends on
the stenographers and shop-girls much more than on the
men with whom their occupation throws them. This, as
everybody knows, is a law of human nature. In England,
custom has, for many generations, decreed that women
shall control the tone of social drinking in the public bars;
and it must be registered to the credit of the host of honorable
women who have served as bar-maids that the tone
of public drinking in England has been lifted to a level
that has not been attained in any other country.</p>

<p>Of English bars and bar-maids I think that I may speak
with a certain authority. In the course of four visits to
England during the last decade, I have traveled over
nearly all the country; I have slept in every county in
England except two, and wandered from town to town
with an insatiable interest; and since I care more about
people than about any other feature of the panoramic
world, I have rarely in my rambles let slip an opportunity
to pass an evening in a public-house and listen to the chat.
To attempt a similar experience in America would be to
discard it with disgust after three or four wasted evenings;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
but in the bars of England there is nearly always someone
who is worthy to repay the task of seeking.</p>

<p>Of English bar-maids as a class I may say with certainty
that they are almost uniformly chaste and&mdash;in the literal
sense of that reverent adjective&mdash;respectable. Most of
them are mature women,&mdash;the average age, I should say,
being rather above thirty than below it; many of them
are married; they have seen much of men and know how
to keep all sorts and conditions in their proper places and
in the proper mood. Yet they exercise this high command
without any affectation of austerity. They are easily
affable and pleasantly familiar with all who come. Many
of them are endowed with a genuine and contagious jollity,&mdash;a
merriment that is not assumed but which has
arisen naturally from continuous converse with men of
many humors. Their business introduces them to all the
world; you step in from the street and know them; they
talk with you frankly from the start, without any preliminary
dodges and retreatings: and yet no one abuses their
easy familiarity. They are addressed with deference as
"Miss"; and the casual loiterer from the street takes leave
of them as if he were saying good-evening to a hostess. In
my entire experience of English bars&mdash;setting aside only
a few in the tragic East End of London&mdash;I have never
heard an obscene story told, and I have never heard the
name of God taken in vain. The conversation is necessarily
refined, out of respect for the women who stand within
hearing. Furthermore, because the bars are tended by
women, there is an accepted rule in every public-house of
any standing that no drink shall ever be served to any customer
who is at all intoxicated. A drunkard who would
resent a refusal from a man accepts it without rudeness
from a girl; and the result of this system is that (barring
the slums, for whose degradation alcohol is not alone responsible)
you can ramble from one end of England to the
other without finding a drunken person in a single bar.</p>

<p>But you will notice at once a tragic change if you cross
the border into Scotland. In Scotland, bars are tended
by men, as in America; and their social tone is immeasurably
lower than that which is maintained in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
They are noisy and riotous; the common conversation is
heavily underscored with profanities and obscenities; and
drunkenness is so prevalent as to seem an habitual detail.
Of course, other causes than the absence of bar-maids contribute
to the foulness of the Scottish public-houses. The
austere and irksome law which makes it impossible to buy
a drink after ten o'clock on any week-day evening and
shuts up every bar in the country throughout the whole of
the unbearable Scottish Sunday leads, naturally, to excessive
and sodden drinking. It is tragic, on a Saturday
evening in Edinburgh or Glasgow, to watch the hampered
laborer and tradesman swilling liquor against the ticking
of the clock in a rash attempt to swallow enough before
the terminal hour of ten to carry them through the intolerable
Sabbath. This is a dark picture, for which the
fanatical austerity of the Scottish law must, in the main,
be held responsible. It would be impossible to imagine
English bar-maids in such a setting; and yet one cannot
help wondering whether they might not alleviate that sodden
atmosphere if they could be introduced in Scotland.</p>

<p>And similarly, one wonders what would happen if we
should introduce them in America. The tone of our saloons
is now prevailingly so low that it seems likely that
if bar-maids were employed sporadically here and there
they would be met with insults and be obliged either to
resign or else to debase themselves. To our shame it must
be said that, as a nation, we do not know how to treat
women when we encounter them suddenly in what is to us
an unaccustomed situation. The English, because they
are many centuries older than we are, evince a traditional
respect for women of all classes and in all circumstances
that to us is not native and instinctive. The waitresses in
our cheap restaurants are usually vulgar and we treat
them vulgarly. It would doubtless take us a long time
to educate ourselves up to bar-maids of the English type;
but if we could successfully adopt the English custom, we
should go far toward solving the problem of the American
saloon, and should relegate the question of prohibition to
the lumber-room of issues that are dead.</p>

<p>Thus far I have spoken only of the ordinary run of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
English bar-maids,&mdash;the affable and wholesome type
that you may encounter everywhere. But those who
linger in the memory are the exceptional among them,
who have made the bar-rooms over which they have presided
memorable among the really worthy places which
one has discovered in the world. The English bar-maid
of the better class creates an atmosphere of hospitable
homeliness&mdash;in the historic sense of that sweetly connotative
word&mdash;which is a boon to everyone who comes
within its influence. You have arrived in a certain city
after dark, a stranger in a strange environment; you have
wandered about the moon-silvered solitude of the hushed
cathedral close, wondering at a majesty half glimpsed and
half imagined; you have mingled with the chattering
multitude in the market-place, profoundly lonely among
many who knew and cared about each other; and at last,
in a hospitable bar-room, you meet without formality a
woman who is glad to talk with you and who mystically,
for an easy half an hour, makes you feel at home. How
much of good may subtly be effected by a system that
makes the homeless feel at home I leave the reader to
imagine. Surely whatever soothes away the loneliness of
the lonely may serve as a specific against the darker moods
and a preventive of vice and even crime.</p>

<p>To the untraveled American, who knows only the saloons
of his own country, it may seem incredible that a
common bar-room should ever feel like home. But there
is a passage in Ruskin which poetically explains this possibility.
In his second lecture in "Sesame and Lilies," he
has been saying that a true woman, wherever she goes,
carries with her the sense of home; and he adds, with a fine
poetic flourish:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The stars only may be over her head; the glow-worm in the
night-cold grass may be the only fire at her foot: but home is yet
wherever she is; and for a noble woman it stretches far round
her, better than ceiled with cedar or painted with vermilion,
shedding its quiet light far, for those who else were homeless.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even if Ruskin in this passage, as all too often in his writings,
may be accused of an excess of sentiment [one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
wonders, for instance, if he has ever actually slept upon "the
night-cold grass" and arisen without rheumatism to write
eloquent prose about it], we may yet discern beneath his
ecstasy of phrasing the existence of a solid and indisputable
truth. Merely to meet a woman who personifies the
sense of homeliness is to feel yourself at home.</p>

<p>And this comfortable sense of homeliness you may find
in many an English bar-maid. If you wish to investigate
upon your own account, you might try Bolland's Restaurant
in Chester, or the Yates Wine Cellar in Manchester,
or the Nelson in Gloucester, or the Crown in Salisbury,
or&mdash;but I am not writing a guide-book to the bars of
England, and, besides, every traveler is likely to fare best
if he is left to his own devices. Of all the English bar-maids
I have known, one (as is but natural) recurs preeminent
in my recollections. I think that I shall tell you
her name, because so many poems echo in it; but I shall
not tell you more precisely where she may be found than
to say that she is one of many who serve drinks in the bar
of one of the great hotels that are clustered near Trafalgar
Square. I think it was I who discovered Eileen; but
I introduced her very soon to several of my friends in
London, and thereafter (forsaking the clubs to which we
had formerly reverted for a talk and a night-cap after the
theatre) we formed a habit of gathering at midnight to
meet Eileen and to chat amicably within the range of her
most hospitable smile until the bar closed at half past
twelve. Assuredly, in that alien metropolis, she made us
feel at home; and we escaped out of the cacophonous
reverberation of the Strand into the quietude of her
presence like men who relax to slippered ease within the
halo of a hearth. "She had a weary little way with her
that made you think of quiet, intimate things,"&mdash;as one
of us said at the outset of one of the many sonnets she inspired.
There is a sweet weariness that reminds you of
lullabying mothers and the drooping eyelids of little children
drifting into dreams; and this was, I think, the
essence of her. Her voice was like the soothing of a cool
hand upon a tired brow. She was very simple in her dark
dress and dark hair; and there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
maiden-motherly in her smile. You saw her most clearly when her
frank eyes looked directly at you and deepened with a
gleam of gentleness, and her lips parted tenderly to answer
to the light within her eyes. Her hand, when she gave it
to you in good-night, was like a memory of her voice; it
had the same softness as of a whisper, it suggested the
same sense of insuperable peace. I grew to know her very
well, and could tell you her history if I would,&mdash;how she
was brought up in the country, one of many children; how,
when her sisters married and she did not (because the men
who came were none of them the right one), she had to
earn her living and began as a bar-maid in a railway station
in the Midlands; how she came up to London and
grew to be (though this she won't admit) a light in her
particular occupation; of the long hours and the scanty
leisure of her labor; of the compensation in the occasional
people who come in and make an hour live with talk that
is illumined and sincere, and in the occasional half-holiday
rambles with a married sister over Hampstead
Heath; of what is worth while in such a life and what is
not; and of how it is that the eyes, though weary, can still
sincerely smile with that glow as of a fireside, and the voice
will evermore grow gentler through the years.</p>

<p>But my purpose is merely to help you to estimate her
effect on us, who used to gather from the four quarters of
London at the midnight hour for the sense of being near
her; and, more generally, to estimate the effect of many
women like Eileen, set in a position of publicity, upon the
community at large. To gather for a social glass in such
an atmosphere is to justify the best that poetry has
claimed for the fruit of the vine. As Browning's Andrea
del Sarto stated,&mdash;"So such things should be."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A MICROBOPHOBIAC</h2>


<p>There was once upon a time a man who underwent
a severe and prolonged attack of Microbophobia.
You may not find the term in the dictionaries, nor in the
medical lexicons; but, as it is quite possible that there are a
variety of things in heaven and earth not yet dreamt of in
the lexicons, there is really no justification for denying the
existence of microbophobia on that ground. And as to
the name itself, there is hydrophobia, and photophobia,
and Anglophobia&mdash;so why not microbophobia?</p>

<p>Microbophobia is a disease of advanced civilization, of
recent origin, and infectious. Its victims are to be found
among the married rather than the unmarried, in the city
rather than in the country, and among the cultured rather
than the uncultured. In a word, the disease rages most in
college and university communities, but is also pronounced
in high school, grade school, and kindergarten spheres of
influence. As all these, however, are in close connection
with colleges and universities, microbophobia may be said
to belong to institutions of higher learning.</p>

<p>Microbophobia rarely succeeds in engrafting itself onto
healthy organisms. No one in perfectly sound mental,
physical, and spiritual health need fear its attacks. Its
host is almost always in a state of depletion at the time of
colonization, and the point of attack invariably the <i>sensus
communis</i>, an organ situated in that part of the anatomy
usually known as the cranial cavity.</p>

<p>Its symptoms&mdash;</p>

<p>But the history of the case shall tell you of the symptoms.</p>

<p>The subject was a professor. It seems that he had laid
the foundations of the disease in his college days by exposing
himself to <i>bacillus scientificus</i>, and contracting a case of
<i>methoditis scientifica</i>, again an ailment whose attack is
directed at the <i>sensus communis</i>, and whose ravages are
greatest among the learned, especially those whose work
necessitates intimate contact with symbols, chemicals, ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
manuscripts, and other odorous and dusty material.
Its victims usually betray their condition by rushing about
insisting that any and all the business of life is susceptible
of the same orderly disposition as the material of their
laboratories.</p>

<p>This explains how it was so easy for microbophobia to
get firm hold of the professor in after days. After taking
the degree of doctor of philosophy, he was called to a university
chair, where, being still in a state of impaired vitality,
he suffered from a recrudescence of <i>methoditis</i>, which
left him so weak that without resistance he fell a prey to
microbophobia in the very first year, the immediate cause
of infection being without doubt his association with various
of his faculty brethren who were in the school of
medicine, or worked in the bacteriological laboratory and
lectured on sanitation, or served on the university committee
of hygiene. All of these men, he afterward learned,
were in various stages of the disease&mdash;though all considered
themselves in perfect health.</p>

<p>For one of the worst things about microbophobia is that
the victim has no suspicion of the real nature of his ailment;
more than that, he falls a prey to the strange hallucination
that it is his environment, and not himself,
which is the seat of infection, and consequently will not
listen to diagnosis. Individuals have been known to advance
in the malady until the <i>sensus communis</i> was all but
absolutely gone, without realizing the gravity of their
condition.</p>

<p>The professor might have gone on for some time; for,
though he was in the grip of the disease, he had not yet
begun to suffer, owing to a good constitution inherited
from sound progenitors who were not university bred.
But an event occurred which hastened the progress of
his malady. He married.</p>

<p>Now, marrying is ordinarily a good thing for the <i>sensus
communis</i>. Many sufferers of both sexes have found it a
most efficacious remedy for the ailments of that rather uncertain
organ. But it so happened that the professor's
alliance was with a member of the Woman's Club, who was
also college bred, a possessor of the degree of Mistress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Home Economics, and, unfortunately, already infected
with microbophobia, and visibly impaired in health.
Some of his bachelor friends had warned him that conditions
in that part of town were notorious, but he laughed
at them, and said that a little fumigation was the worst
that could happen.</p>

<p>The gravest fears of the professor's friends, however,
were soon realized. They saw him begin to sink before
their eyes. In his low state of vitality, he was soon hopelessly
in the clutches of the dread malady. Even if he had
not been vitally reduced, his case would have been desperate,
for his wife continued to expose herself week after
week at the club. And besides, she took several Health
Journals, all of which came from infected centers, and
which not only she, but the professor himself, handled with
all the carelessness of immunes. The professor read at first
because he was amused, but it was not long before he, as
well as his wife, hovered with almost religious devotion
over the column headed Sanitas Sanitatum, by Doctor
Septic Septington, which he ought to have known was
swarming with <i>bacillus microbophobicus</i>.</p>

<p>The ravages of the disease in both of them were frightful
to behold. The professor's case developed with especial
rapidity, so that in a few months both were in the same
stage.</p>

<p>Stage? Yes, the stages of this disease are very clearly
marked. In the first stage, you are attacked by a noticeable
degree of thirst for knowledge about microbes; you
read and talk about them constantly, and attend lectures
on them at the university and the club.</p>

<p>This is a mild stage. You are for the most part amused,
and only occasionally entertain the strange hallucinations
which afterward come to possess you so thoroughly. Just
to quiet your conscience, however, you adopt a few precautions&mdash;such
as the use of bottled spring water, and
the increase of your interest in the appearance and personal
habits of the dairyman. This stage is termed <i>microbophobia
intellectualis</i>. The professor and his wife early
passed through it, with no serious results.</p>

<p>The second stage is more grave. You insist on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
certificate from your dairyman, visit his barns, have the milk
examined by your friend in the university laboratory, and
finally, to be absolutely sure, pasteurize it. The drinking
water you begin to filter and boil, you withdraw your
patronage from the Chinese laundryman because you have
heard of the dreadful way he sprinkles the linen, and you
take an active interest in the enforcement of the anti-salivation
ordinance and the encouragement of the bubble-cup
campaign.</p>

<p>It is at this point that Dread, the most characteristic
manifestation of the malady, begins to assume really noticeable
proportions. You dread going out to dinner, for
example, because you are afraid that the water and milk
on your friend's table will not be properly sterilized. You
don't like to abstain from both, and you don't like to attract
attention by taking a bottle of boiled water or milk
with you. The result is, that you avoid going out at all,
and when you are compelled to go, you take a double dose
of microbicide. You dread the effects of the public school
system, with all its opportunities for the distribution of
microbes. Your dread extends even to the communion,
and so grows on you that you omit the sacrament because
of the common cup&mdash;or, if you are a Foot-washing Baptist,
because of the common basin. The second stage is
denominated <i>microbophobia alarmans</i>.</p>

<p>The professor and his wife were uncomfortable enough
in this stage, but in the third they really suffered, though
of course with cheerful resignation; for were they not enduring
their hardships in the interest of science and for
the good of mankind? The third stage is known to science
as <i>microbophobia parentum</i>; in popular parlance, the baby
stage. Its symptoms are most pronounced in the female.
The first thing you do in this stage is to order Madame
di Ana's Daily, "The Mother-Maker," together with her
two fine volumes on "The Mistakes of Mothers," and
"Microbes in the Home." You also join the Mothers'
Club, and take your husband to the open meetings. You
make him cut off his beard, because you have read how
it looks under the microscope&mdash;and he <i>will</i> kiss the baby.
You boil not only the drinking water, but the water for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the baby's bath, and the water you wash your hands
in before you take him up; and you insist on the sterilization
of all the baby's linen, and all the nurse's apparel.
You are determined that the child shall be brought up
scientifically, and not be exposed to the risks you ran in
<i>your</i> childhood. Having read that mothers are subject
to excitement, and that excitement is bad for the fountain
source of baby's sustenance, you substitute a bottle; and
you use pasteurized milk scientifically compounded with
other ingredients which nature forgot to employ in her
chemistry; and warm it in a sterilized glass jar, set in
sterilized water in a sterilized pan in a room which is
disinfected twice a day, and you test it with a sterilized
thermometer. You keep on hand a bath of boiling water
in which you sterilize at frequent intervals all the usual
playthings&mdash;nipples, rubber rings, rattles, etc.; and you
make due provision for the little fingers which seem so
bent on going into the little mouth.</p>

<p>In this stage you also avoid shaking hands, never allow
yourself to touch a door knob barehanded, and leave off
drawing books from the library, determined to be neither
a borrower nor a lender of books or anything else; and,
even though your church has deferred to scientific suggestion
and introduced individual communion cups, you
still shrink from the sacrament because the bread, too,
is not individualized, and you are not sure about the
linen which covered it, or the silver which contained the
grape juice, or the person who picked the grapes, or the
feet by which the juice was trodden out.</p>

<p>The fourth stage is known as <i>microbophobic moscophobia</i>,
which is the pathological term describing the fear of flies
as carriers of infection. You get new screens, interrupt
the housemaid every half hour with orders to see whether
there are more flies to be found, cover the baby and yourself
with netting when you nap, have a cement pit made
for the garbage can, and repaper or repaint your interiors&mdash;that
is, the interiors of your house&mdash;every six
months. You read, too, that mosquitoes carry yellow
fever in the West Indies, and malaria in Italy&mdash;distant
places, indeed; but still, why shouldn't mosquitoes fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
across the sea and land and light on the baby, or yourself?
So you screen the household by day as well as by night,
and avoid evenings out and picnics in the shade.</p>

<p>In the latter part of this stage you also change your
religion on account of the communion service, have your
letters disinfected, leave off kissing the baby, steer to
windward of rug-beaters and street sweepers, hold your
breath as you pass dogs and cats, eat nothing not cooked,
drink nothing not boiled, carry a bottle of microbicide in
your pocket, dream that the earth is full of microbes as
the waters cover the sea, and that the hand of every one
of them is lifted against you, and have cold sweats at
night and cold feet by day. You realize that you are
uncomfortable, but the real cause of it never occurs to
you: you attribute your condition to the uncleanliness
of your environment, and to your willingness to sacrifice
your own comfort to the cause of scientific sanitation.</p>

<p>By this time, too, your sense of humor, never very
robust, has decayed, atrophied, and disappeared. Your
fat, good-humored, unscientific neighbor calls out from
his back porch as you come out to yours to get the milk
bottle: "Dangerous stuff, that there! They say they's
forty-three million four hundred an' ninety-nine thousand
two hundred an' seventeen microbes in a half a drop of
it"&mdash;and you don't laugh, any more than you laugh
when you advise your professor friend to disinfect the
contents of his pay envelope, and he replies, "Don't
worry&mdash;there's no microbe could ever live on my salary!"</p>

<p>In the fifth stage you begin to be physically as well as
spiritually uncomfortable. In the eloquent words of the
old hymn, you are a prey to "fightings without and fears
within." What with the insufficiency of your means to
meet the demands of disinfection, and what with the
difficulty of getting properly prepared food even if you
have the money, and what with the continual strain of
anxiety lest you entertain a microbe unawares, you grow
thin and nervous. Of course you continue to lay it to
microbes, and double your precautions&mdash;and worry
more, and starve more. If you are not rescued, you
finally pass into <i>delirium microbophobicum</i>, which is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
much more awful than <i>delirium tremens</i> as microbes are
smaller and more insidious and wiser than serpents.</p>

<p>The professor and his wife entered upon the fifth stage,
and were alarmingly near the last extreme. If this were
a subject for levity, and not for high seriousness, I should
be tempted to parody the essayist on Man, and say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, the poor professor, whose untutored mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw microbes in the clouds, and heard them in the wind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But they were saved. One night the professor's wife
dreamed that a monster centipedal microbe slowly let
himself down from the ceiling, and enveloped her in his
hundred long wriggling legs. She awoke screaming, to
find herself enmeshed in the mosquito bar.</p>

<p>The next day they called another doctor. Hitherto,
their doctors themselves had been infected, though neither
they nor their patients knew it. But this time they were
more fortunate; Dr. Goodenough had been attacked by
the disease, had made a brilliant recovery, and consequently
was immune.</p>

<p>He listened to the history of their cases, gave them a
thorough examination, using his new instrument, the
cranioscope&mdash;of course more for the purpose of inspiring
confidence in his patients than to find out anything; for
he well knew what ailed them.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed," he finally said. "You really <i>are</i>
in a bad state; but I give you my word for it that you will
recover. I find your <i>sensus communis</i> all but disappeared.
A little more excitement like that of last night, and you
might have a hemorrhage&mdash;and there you are! Now put
yourself entirely in my hands, or I'll not answer for the
consequences."</p>

<p>He reached for his prescription blank, and after a few
moments handed them a bit of unintelligible writing&mdash;the
sort that only doctors and their druggist partners can
interpret. As I happen to be in the secret, I may tell
you that the prescription called for three fluid ounces of
city water, not distilled, with two drops of aniline, a
drop of nux vomica, a lump of sugar, and a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of whiskey, and that the druggist charged them a dollar
and seventy-five cents.</p>

<p>"Begin taking immediately," said the doctor impressively.
"Take two drops and a half in a half glass of
boiled water every three hours from six a. m. to nine p. m.
And you must go into the country to-morrow morning,
and spend your whole vacation there.... Leave orders
for your magazines and journals of all kinds to be held
here, tell your friends they are to write you under no
circumstances, and don't dare to come back to town on
any errand whatsoever. Cut loose from everything! Delay
is dangerous, and might be fatal."</p>

<p>The professor and his wife didn't dare to disobey. The
doctor was a vigorous and imposing personality, and he
had terrified them. They didn't know what a <i>sensus
communis</i> was, even though the professor was a Latinist;
the doctor had disguised the term by using the English
pronunciation, and imagination contributed the usual
amount to the impressiveness of his words.</p>

<p>So they packed up all their pasteurizers and sterilizers
and disinfectors and bottles and screens and other antiseptic
paraphernalia, and drove into the country to a
farm fifteen miles away from any car-line or railroad,
where there was no telephone or other connection with
the scene of their unhappiness.</p>

<p>They hadn't got out of sight of the town before they
began to feel differently. No one but a college professor
knows how big his institution seems while he is within its
precincts, and how small and insignificant when he is
out of sight of it. The tension left their bodies and minds,
and a balmy sense of repose and freedom succeeded.</p>

<p>But they felt a shock when, just as their carriage disappeared
from view over the hill on its return, they saw
two dogs and a half dozen cats on the porch of the farmhouse,
noticed that the well was not more than ninety
feet from the pigpen, whereas all the journals said it should
be one hundred, and became sensible of the drowsy murmur
of swarms of flies about the kitchen door, attracted
thither by a barrel which was wide open&mdash;and smelled!</p>

<p>That was not all, however. Fortune seemed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
them. It was bad enough for themselves, though they
could sterilize their drinking water and pasteurize their
milk, and exercise many other of their wonted precautions;
but when it came to the baby, they were almost
powerless. Watch him as they would, he was continually
getting into unhygienic predicaments of the most dreadful
description. Before they even entered the house, he had
grasped one dog by the tail, and been thrown down by the
other, as a mere mark of welcome; and when he got up,
crying, in the instinctive effort to console himself of course
he resorted to the habit of sucking his fingers, and put
into his mouth two of those on the hand which had grasped
the tail. The next moment, too, he was licked all over
the nose and mouth by the repentant dog that had knocked
him off his feet. Horrors!</p>

<p>And then the cats followed him into the house, and
rubbed against his legs and licked his fingers, while he
gave little screams of delight at the novel sensation. At
supper, he toddled to the table in advance of the rest,
and before his mother realized his intentions, had an
unsterilized spoon in his mouth; and after supper he
succeeded in browbeating the baby of the house, who was
a month or so younger, and more timid than his experienced
guest from the city, into giving up his gum.</p>

<p>The professor and his wife were horrified, but helpless.
He went on in that way for a week. They simply could
not keep track of him. He drank out of the horse-trough,
dabbled in the puddles, consorted with pigs and chickens,
shared his bread with the dogs and his milk with the cats,
picked up crumbs from the dining-room sweepings, looked
upon half rotten, muddy, and fly-specked apples found
on the lawn as the greatest of prizes, and reveled in delight
with old scraps of rags and hats and shoes which
he, with the little country comrade under his leadership,
resurrected from the most unlikely and unsanitary places.</p>

<p>The frightened and powerless parents read up again
on the periods of incubation of all the microbes mentioned
in the books. They could at least be ready with plans
to meet whatever came, and cope with it at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>But it didn't come. At the end of two weeks nothing
had happened. The child slept well and ate all he could
get, and was in the best of spirits. At the end of three
weeks he had gained four pounds. It was in direct and
flagrant violation of all reason and all science, and thoroughly
incomprehensible; but what could you do?</p>

<p>After much marvelling at the failure of science, however,
they concluded to make a virtue of what was plainly
a necessity, and gave the baby the freedom of the farm.
And more than that; after a decent period of worrying,
they too began to tread the primrose path, and let the
little child lead them. They drank unsterilized milk and
unboiled water, threw all precaution to the winds, rough-and-tumbled
with the boys and dogs on the lawn, napped
under the trees unprotected from flies and mosquitoes,
ate apples with the skins and all, and without even washing
them, went fishing in the creek a mile away up the
marsh, and when overcome by blazing thirst drank of
the water in the stream, played peg and got their mouths
full of dirt, drew pictures for the children on the slate and
erased them in the old familiar way&mdash;and did all the
other reckless things they had done in their own childhood,
when the microbe had not yet made a stir in the
world, when <i>delirium tremens</i> was still the worst example of
pathological misfortune, and nervous prostration had not
yet spread to the masses.</p>

<p>When they returned to the city, clothed and in their
right minds, they brought with them the half emptied
medicine bottle, and charged smiling Dr. Goodenough
with duplicity. He charged <i>them</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, we shall not say what he charged them. Whatever
it was, they engaged him for the next baby, and were
grateful to him ever afterward. And as for microbes,
before having to do with them in the future, they resolved
to let them come at least half way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE STANDING INCENTIVES TO WAR</h2>


<p>Each civilized nation protects itself from war by
being ready at any moment to fight any other nation.
Each other nation is supposed to be charged with the spirit
of aggression, and it is supposed that that spirit can be
allayed only by steadily increasing the risks involved in
attack.</p>

<p>The modern War System has grown up unconsciously,
by way of using war as a protection against war. The
principle is that of fighting the devil with fire. As each
nation, Great Britain beginning it, has increased its fighting
material so as to assure its superiority over all rivals,
so has each rival doubled its own armament with the same
impossible ambition. All this has increased until the
greatest security against war lies in the absolutely ruinous
cost with which war is prosecuted.</p>

<p>The average man in England, France and Germany still
believes, with more or less insistence, that patriotism goes
with armor plate. The fact that there exists no enemy
who wishes to attack, or cares to attack, or hopes to attack,
or could afford to attack, or would gain anything
whatever by attack, counts for little in this discussion. It
is always best to be on the safe side, and the money it costs
is cheap insurance against burning seaports and plundered
banks. The enemy will strike when he dares, but not
against an odds of 2 to 1 or even 5 to 3. As the enemy
swells his equipment to correspond, each nation is therefore
certainly in immediate and imminent danger; its
safety lies in more armed men and armored ships; and in
each nation all resources of borrowing, taxation, and conscription
must be strained, that the enemy may continue
to realize that the odds are still against him.</p>

<p>To the observer on the outside, all this rests on a series
of chimeras, the product for the most part of men financially
interested in the war system itself. The war scares,
the wars of talk but not of action, which sweep over
Europe, would be ridiculous but for their baleful consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we come to the secret springs of all this. The
elements of the War System are not only armies and
navies, but also war traders, armament builders, money
lenders, the recipients of special privileges, the corrupt
portion of the press, and all others drawn into its service
by choice, by interest, or by necessity.</p>

<p>About war scares and war equipment, matters inherent
in the War System, centre the grossest exhibitions of
human greed. Those who scent from afar "the cadaverous
odor of lucre" have for the most part furnished war's
dominant motive.</p>

<p>The cost of it all, the war and the War System, is spread
over the whole world. It is felt by you and by me and by
everyone, in the rising price of all articles of necessity.
The world, to the degree in which it is civilized, has become
an economic unit. Whatever wastes its substance
here or there, robs your pocket and mine.</p>

<p>It is among officers of the army and navy, especially
those retired from active service, that we find the most
ardent apologists for war. To this end they are trained,
and in Europe alone they find justification for particular
wars, as well as arguments for war in general as a means of
securing peace. They can be counted on for scares or
warnings in every case when petty differences arise.</p>

<p>Nowhere does the military class seem to have any
thought or care for ways or means. Economic preparations,
the saving of money, or even the ability to borrow
it, counts for nothing with the militarist, to whom the need
to avert war by war outweighs all other considerations.</p>

<p>There have been in all countries many noble exceptions
to this point of view, great soldiers who have confessed
with General Sherman, that they are "sick and tired of
war," its "moonshine" glories and its cruel realities.
There are in the service of every great nation generals
and admirals whom every lover of peace is proud to honor.
But the rank and file are creatures of the system, and as
such their influence is felt on the side of war and waste.
The advocates of "peace by preponderance," of peace
through risk, of peace through assured victory, must be
counted on the side of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of the service journals in every nation
shows this to be true. Presumably these periodicals meet
the demands made on them, and each and every one, so
far as I know, is a purveyor of war scares, an advocate of
expenditure, and an agency in behalf of the war system
and all of its ramifications.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the central force of the War System does not lie
with the war makers but with the great war traders. We
may never underrate a power which has such "big money"
behind it. The manufacturers of war implements the
world over form, through "interlocking directorates" and
through other means, a gigantic coöperating international
trust, perhaps the most powerful, because certainly the
most profitable, organization of its kind in the world. It
is the more efficient and the more dangerous because, alone
among great trusts, it has a privileged character as the
exponent of the highest patriotism, of the great fundamental
duty of "National Defense."</p>

<p>The methods of organization of the syndicates for war,
and of their influence on national expenditures, have been
lately set forth in detail in two remarkable papers, the
one by George Herbert Perris of London, entitled "The
War Traders," the other by Francis Delaisi of Paris, entitled
"Le Patriotisme des Plaques Blindées," (the
Patriotism of Armored Plates).</p>

<p>Mr. Perris tells us of the affairs of the great British companies&mdash;the
Armstrong-Whitworth Corporation, the
Vickers, the John Brown, the Cammell-Laird and the
Coventry Arms Company, with their allies, tentacles and
satellites feeding the patriotism, under many flags, of
nearly half the globe. Delaisi's memoir tells of the Krupps
and other concerns in Germany, and of the Creusots and
similar armament trusts in France.</p>

<p>The capital invested in all the British firms amounts to
about $250,000,000, the dividends ranging each year from
7-1/2% to 15% of the capital stock. In this industry, ten
per cent. is a satisfactory return, counting stockholders,
employees, soldiers and pensioners. Mr. Perris claims that
"it is probable that 1,500,000 adult able-bodied men, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
in six of the occupied adult males in the United Kingdom,
shares to some extent in the 73,000,000 pounds
($365,000,000) a year which 'National Defense' now costs
us." Besides the minor outgoes which form a sort of
bribe money to the general public, the distribution of
dividends affects a smaller but most influential class. In
the share lists of the Armstrong-Whitworth company,
Mr. Perris finds the names of 60 noblemen or noble families,
15 baronets, 20 knights, 8 members of parliament,
20 officers of army or navy, and 8 journalists. Shareholding
in the war syndicates and membership in the naval
league go together. But rich and poor are alike affected
by the large returns. "Militarism is strong in England
because Lazarus gets some poor pickings from the feast
of Dives."</p>

<p>These great companies especially promote the patriotism
of Great Britain, but they are controlled by no narrow
nativism. Under other flags the same people develop the
same noble sentiments. These British corporations, individually
or coöperating, maintain three ship building
companies in Canada: hence the recent movement for a
Canadian navy, to be built in Canadian Yards. They
have five tentacles or subsidiary companies in Italy,
(Pozzuoli, Ansaldo, Odero, Terni, and Orlando), one in
Spain (Ferrol), one in Portugal, and one in Japan. "Time
was when Englishmen bled for Portugal; now our old-time
ally must bleed for us." The relations of these British
trusts with similar groups in other countries are most close
and friendly. In the "Harvey United Steel Company"
(wound up in 1911), we find them in international combination
with the Bethlehem Steel Plant in Pennsylvania,
the Creusot company in France, and the Essen and Dillingen
concerns in Germany, with a similar international
combination of supporting banks. "In forty years," observes
Perris, "all the Peace Societies have not succeeded
in effecting such a Franco-German reconciliation as this.
In the share list (of this company) Mr. Newbold found the
names of one British general and two major generals, and
behind these were the shadowy figures of a vast host of
princes, peers, ministers of the Crown, soldiers, sailors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
clerics. A veritable Brotherhood in Arms! I cannot believe
that the Harvey United Steel Company is really dead.
Somewhere it surely has had a glorious resurrection!
Under some metamorphoses it lives and works to prove
the pettiness of national prejudice and the ease of forgetting
such sores as Alsace-Lorraine, when men have
learned the golden wisdom of 'good business.'"</p>

<p>A needed accessory of such good business is a series of
commercial agents, "the strong silent men," who frequent
every court of Europe. Incidental to their work of making
sales, is to <i>create</i> a market. This is done by means of
the recurrent war scares. A third element of importance
is the reiteration of the constant fact that only the latest
inventions can serve in war, and that all former purchases
should be "scrapped" as rapidly as possible. Were it not
for the scrapping process, the world's market for implements
of destruction would be speedily glutted. The
machinery of war has reached such marvelous perfection
and such an acme of cost that the work of a day may
bankrupt a whole nation. The issue of a campaign may
be decided by the control of a single murderous invention.
Thus science has been called into the service of war, to a
degree that inspires the hope that, by carrying its risks to
madness, it makes war virtually impossible. But meanwhile
the expenses go on.</p>

<p>And under such influences half the people of England,
let us say&mdash;professors, business men, manufacturers,
workingmen, heads of colleges, and dignitaries of the
church, with nine-tenths of the army and navy, are agents,
conscious or unconscious, of the British armament trust.
The greater the stock of weapons, the newer and more
varied the instruments of physical defense, the more pitiful
and more persistent are the fears of invasion. A most
striking example of the collective cowardice of a great but
over-armed nation, made up of men individually brave,
is found in the fear to open a tunnel under the British
Channel. Every need of commerce, of travel, of the
friendliness with France, demands the removal of a most
unpleasant and expensive obstacle. Nowhere in the world
is there tolerated another such stumbling block in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
way of a gigantic traffic, as that of the present system of
crossing the English Channel. And yet half of England
cries out against the simple remedy, lest, having over-powered
Northern France, the German hordes should
come pouring into Dover, before the watchman at the
portcullis should have time to drop the gates.</p>

<p>The triumph of the war trades in Germany has been
even more rapid and complete than in Great Britain. By
the system of interlocking directorates, the house of Krupp
is in alliance with all centres of German finance. The
army, the aristocracy, the ministry, the armament syndicates,
are all bound together in that mailed-fist coöperation
in which the power of Germany seems to lie. The
King of Prussia himself inherited from his august grandfather
stock in the Krupp concern to the amount of five
million of thalers, an investment now estimated at about
$12,000,000.</p>

<p>The House of Krupp by various means has placed itself
at the summit of German war patriotism, and it has made
most thrifty use of its opportunities. It employs 250,000
persons, 60,000 of these on salary; 5,000 engineers. It
maintains, according to Delaisi, a great hotel, the Essenerhof,
"l'Auberge de la Mort," in which are entertained
most royally all emissaries of all nations who come as
purchasing agents of tools of death. Its specialty is
"National Defense," and "Defense not Defiance" is said
to be the "international code signal."</p>

<p>In France "armor plate patriotism" is sustained by the
same methods, and in part by the same money. The leading
industries bear the names of Creusot, Homicourt, and
Châtillon-Commentry. A special feature of the French
system, not unknown to the others, is its free use of representatives
of the army and navy. Some twenty admirals
and generals have left the public service for the better
paid work of selling guns and ships. This transfer of allegiance
is said to be "perfectly legal," but it is also dangerous
to the morale of the public service. And it is to these
men that we owe most of the militant revival of French
war patriotism, which had lain dormant from the time of
the "Affaire Dreyfus," to that of the "Affaire Agadir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the war-syndicates in the United States, little that
is definite is on record. Like conditions produce like results.
The Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Daniels, reports
the existence of a combination among the three chief producers
of armor plate in America, the Midvale, Bethlehem,
and Carnegie Companies. He is reported as saying:
"When this administration came into office, we found that
the Navy was apparently, or, so we were assured, hopelessly,
at the mercy of the three big steel corporations, who
submitted practically identical bids for armor forgings and
other materials, and then divided the work between them
to suit themselves." As a result of this condition, the
Secretary rejected their bids, and by going outside, recorded
a saving of $500,000 on the battleship in question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Behind the war traders, stand their allies, the finance
houses who lend money for the war system. These are
not bankers, rather pawnbrokers, dealing in the credit of
nations for a certain per cent., according to the straits in
which the borrower finds himself. The banking system
of London avoids this class of risks. Paris is now the centre
of the system, and it is usually stipulated with every
foreign war loan that the materials it covers should be
bought in Paris. In earlier times, before the great nations
had borrowed to the limit, the heads of these finance
houses as "Masters of Europe" exerted great personal influence,
permitting or forbidding wars. Of recent years
this personal power has greatly dwindled, as joint stock
companies of greater capital and more or less impersonal
management, have largely taken their place. The present
influence of the money-lenders is against war, but in favor
of the war system. Minor wars it permits or even encourages,
but these have their risks. The second Balkan
war, unforeseen and undesired, is said to have entailed a
loss of some $30,000,000 to the Paris backers of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Interlocking with the finance houses are the great exploiting
corporations of the world, operating mostly in the
backward nations of the tropics. These "interests" are
often all-powerful in foreign affairs. They are frequently
able to control the operations of the foreign offices to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
a degree that the foreign policy of a great nation is often
but the expression of their will. The desire for colonial
expansion, the "mirage of the map," is a reflection of these
interests, and most "imperial wars" have been undertaken
for their benefit. Abundant illustrations may be
had from the recent history of each of the leading nations.
Civil wars in the tropics, as a rule, have their origin in
conflicting interests of people remote from the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Another factor supporting the war system is the hereditary
aristocracy, waning in influence, but still powerful
through its control of money, of the army, and of the
Church. The profession of arms is almost the only one
not unworthy of the caste of nobleman. The military
constitutes the right arm of aristocracy; the state church,
the left; while the monarch stands as the visible head.
The leaders of official religion are, with many and honorable
exceptions, upholders of the war system, and apologists
for the "God of Battles." The dissenting churches,
having no alliance with privilege, are almost as unanimously
on the side of peace.</p>

<p>With all this, and working toward the same end, is the
false education which the war system has unconsciously
produced. For generations it has obstructed sound teaching
of history, of patriotism, of morals, of religion. It is
only after reaching manhood, if at all, that we realize that
Thackeray's "redcoat bully in his boots" has not been the
maker of England's greatness. In the schools of all nations,
the man of violence is the hero&mdash;the man on horse-back,
the man who bears the flag, even if in defiance of
justice and order.</p>

<p>We have been taught that nations grow strong through
war, and that through war they achieve their destiny.
Each man who falls in battle on any side, in any cause,
is a patriot hero, giving his life for fatherland and for
religion. Each boy learns that his own nation was in the
right in every quarrel, that in every battle it was victorious
against great odds, or else defeated through base
treachery.</p>

<p>For the war system as it exists to-day, first and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
responsible are the people who pay for it, the common
man in the nations concerned. The government belongs
to him. It is his own fault if it does not. It cannot go
far ahead of him, and it never lags much behind. When
it is laggard, the fault still rests with him. He has neglected
to look after the machinery of government, and it
has been turned against him. This is the case in Germany
and in Russia, where the government represents only part
of the people. In these nations, the man belongs to the
state. In the more democratic nations, the state belongs
to the man, who has therefore the more pressing responsibility.</p>

<p>And this man on the street, the unit of the nation,
whether noble or commoner, whether educated or illiterate,
overlooks one fundamental fact. The other nations
of Europe are made up of men about like himself. What
he thinks, they think; what he hopes, they hope. If he
has no designs of aggression, neither have they. If he is
"hungry for peace," so are they. If he finds his taxes distressing,
so do they. If he is one of a majority favoring
more cordial relations between states, they belong to a
like majority. If he is one of a minority who would do
away with the war system, there is a similar minority
which will meet him half way. If he is a workman, his
problems are those of all other workmen; if he harbors no
evil designs of a war of invasion, neither do his fellow-workmen
across the border. If he is swept off his feet by
a burst of martial music and resounding patriotism, so are
they, and it is just as easy for them to recover as it is for
him. If he is scared by the reckless talk of pangermanists
across the channel, or of chauvinists on the Paris Boulevards,
or of panslavists in St. Petersburg, or of jingoes in
London or New York, let him remember that he finds just
such people at home, wherever his home may be&mdash;just
as many, just as noisy, and possessed of just as little permanent
influence. The force of mere noise grows less and
less, year by year, in each of the "settled nations." If
you are convinced that other nations need have no fear of
your jingoes, by the same token you need not fear
theirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The War System is making this great, rich, resourceful
world a bankrupt concern in the hands of its creditors.
The nations of the earth still owe some 40 billions of dollars
in gold for the wars of the last 100 years, from Waterloo
to Adrianople. But one nation of all the number (our
own) has made any progress whatever in paying its share
of this debt. The tendency is ever to borrow more, up to
and beyond the limit of credit. The interest is paid, perhaps
by borrowing, but there is no haste about the principal.
Except for war, no nation on earth would ever
need to borrow a dollar.</p>

<p>And this interest money of a billion and a quarter every
year is only an incident in the cost of the War System&mdash;about
a fourth of its annual expense, even in what we call
times of peace. Under the armed peace of the War System,
a kind of frustrate war goes on, an antagonism the
more repulsive because no one has the slightest idea what
it is all about. This antagonism is simply part of the
system, and the system itself is only organized cowardice,
for it is perfectly well known that not one of the great nations
has any design to attack any other. Only the poor
crude Balkan people have taken the War System seriously.
Because they have done so, and interfered with trade, they
are now under the ban of Europe, as they lie supine on the
floor of the arena.</p>

<p>The War System has exhausted its own resources. The
great nations have no money with which to fight, and no
stomach for fighting. The concert of Europe is content
with the suppression of discords among its own players.
And the reason for this is clearly indicated in the words
of Mr. H. Bell of Lloyds Bank in London. He calls the
attention of bankers to "the great spectre which will rise
up in future before the monied classes when they are invited
to lend their money for warlike purposes. There is
going to be very clearly written in the handwriting on the
wall the word '<span class="smcap">Repudiation</span>.' The peoples of Europe will
say: 'We know we ought to pay our interest. We know we
ought to pay our debt, but we cannot. We are human
beings, we must live; we are overtaxed; we cannot get
enough to clothe ourselves; we cannot get enough to eat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
We can get no profit from our work!' The men who find
money for purposes of war will not get their money back
again."&mdash;(H. Bell. Remarks before the Institute of
Bankers, Jan. 17, 1912.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>War cripples the nation physically by cutting off without
posterity its strongest and boldest men. The key of national
strength in the future is found in the good parentage
of to-day. The basis of national greatness is indicated
in the principles of Eugenics. To be well born is the first
step to an effective life. "Like the seed is the harvest."
This is the law of heredity. It applies to races of men as
well as to breeds of horses or of sheep. No nation has
ever fallen from leadership, intellectual or physical, save
through breeding from inferior stock. The causes of all
decline may be sought among these three factors, emigration,
immigration, war. Rome fell when her streets
swarmed with the sons of slaves, scullions, sutlers, adventurers,
men who were not Romans. When, after her
wars, internal and external, "Only cowards remained, and
from their brood came forth the new generations." The
culture of Greece passed away when war had obliterated
the Greeks. "Send forth the best ye breed" and you will
breed from the second best. First best, second best, third
best and fourth among the yeomanry of Europe have been
swallowed up in war in the "Obscene seas of slaughter"
over which Europe has gloried and gloated through all
these deluded ages.</p>

<p>The decline in the physique of the average man in
France has been usually cited in evidence of this tendency.
But the same causes have produced like effects in every
warlike nation, and the decline in stature is one of the
least important of the results of reversal of selection.
These changes are just as marked in England and Scotland,
as in France, and they are not wanting in Germany.
The loss of dash and initiative is one of these results.
Havelock Ellis observes: "The reckless Englishmen who
boldly sailed out from their little island to fight the Spanish
Armada were long ago exterminated; an admirably
prudent and cautious race has been left alive." Better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
men would make better history. Braver men would not
cower at the war scares of to-day. Men of character and
initiative would not wallow in the London slums. The
sons of those war could not use, swell the records of
pauperism. It is not the strength of the strong but the
weakness of the weak that invites and perpetuates paternalism
and tyranny, two names for the same thing.
"Slaves may have wrongs, but only free men have
rights."</p>

<p>Another count against the War System, not unrelated
to this, is its pollution of the blood of the race. The
"White Slave Traffic" goes with the "Conscription Act,"
both outgrowths of the War System. Army movement
and barrack life have been leading, though not exclusive,
causes of the widespread diffusion of infectious diseases,
one of the most alarming features of civilization to-day.</p>

<p>Another count against war, as yet scarcely realized, is
found in the vandalisms by which it has destroyed so
much of worth as well as of intellectual importance in the
art and the architecture of the past. War respects nothing.
It was German bombs which burned the library at
Strassburg. The devastation of the art world is chargeable
to war. As I write this there rise before me the paintings
in the gallery at Munich, of the twenty-one cities of
Greece, from Sparta to Corinth, from Eleusis to Salamis,
not as they are now, largely fishing hamlets by the blue
Ægean Sea, not as they were in the days of the glory of
Greece&mdash;but as ruined arches and broken columns, half
buried in the ashes of war, the war which blotted out
Greece from the world history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is plain that sooner or later such a system must come
to an end. The influences that have abolished cannibalism,
slavery, and religious persecution must in the end do
away with international war. It seems also clear that this
result will not be obtained primarily in any direct way by
official action. The administrators of nations must follow
public opinion rather than create it. Where public opinion
demanded the burning of witches, the officials had only
to see that it was done decently and in order. At the most,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
they could only limit the number to be consumed on any
one occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is our line of attack on the War System?</p>

<p>For the suppression of war we must have a public
opinion. And this opinion must not rest only on the fact
that war is brutal and hideous. That is only half the
struggle. There are many good men to whom the brutal is
also the heroic, and still others to whom evil methods are
condoned by success. We must further convince the world,
that is, the common man, the man on the street, that
modern war attacks his pocket.</p>

<p>The modern phases of the Peace Movement differ from
the earlier ones in being educational rather than emotional.
The early workers were convinced that war was wicked
and unholy, and with this they were usually content to
rest their case.</p>

<p>With the same conviction as to the immorality of war,
in the bottom of his heart, the modern worker tries to
find the facts. What is the historical evolution of war?
What are its effects, economic, biological, moral? What
can be found as a national substitute? And side by side
with the study of war and war problems, rises the fabric
of international law. We may not say that the modern
method is more righteous than the earlier, or even more
effective. But the treatment of the subject from all its
various points of view, and not mainly from that of morals
and religion, reaches a much wider audience and has a
more immediate effect upon public opinion.</p>

<p>It is an immediate purpose of the Peace Movement to
make war a last resort, not the first one, in times of international
differences. To this and every agency which
tends to postpone action and give the blood time to cool,
must contribute.</p>

<p>In civil life, there has been through the ages, a steady
movement from violence to law, from the ordeal of private
combat to the arbitration of the courts. In like
fashion, we would extend and strengthen the parallel
tendency among nations. Already arbitration is everywhere
welcomed as a means of composing differences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Conciliation goes before arbitration and is a factor of
equal importance. The very existence of an Arbitral
Tribunal before which differences may be brought, itself
insures that most differences will be adjusted without
its agency. If war is really the last resort, very few nations
will ever come to it, and the War System will decline
through neglect, as of obvious uselessness.</p>

<p>But so long as the War System is in full force, there is
always danger of war. So great an agency can never be
fully under control. Its existence insures the presence of
a powerful group of men, anxious to test its powerful
machinery and impatient of civil authority. The War
System is designed for war, defensive of course, but it is a
maxim of war, as of football, that the best defense is to
be the first to score.</p>

<p>As to the Arbitration treaties and the hundreds of disputes
which have been settled for all time by the tribunals
at The Hague, no verdict thus obtained has yet been rejected
or opposed, and none is likely to be. The public
opinion of the world would be as wholly opposed to the
repudiation of an adverse verdict as it would be to the
repudiation of a national debt. The verdict and the debt
involve the same sanction of national honor.</p>

<p>The discussion as to the need of an international police
to enforce decisions made at The Hague, is therefore wide
of the mark as there can be no occasion for the use of force
in such a connection.</p>

<p>It is becoming more and more evident in Europe that
the greatest single asset of the Peace Movement is the
success of the republic of America.</p>

<p>America is opposed to the War System. There is a much
larger percentage of pacifists in the United States than in
any other of the larger nations. For one thing, it is relatively
easy to be a peace man in a republic. No criticism or
obloquy attaches to it. But in Europe, the direction of
least resistance is to follow the wake of the War System.</p>

<p>In spite of the unhallowed sums we have carelessly
spent to build up a War System, we have none. We shall
never have any. Should we pass under its yoke we should
cease to be America. Even our admirals and generals do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
not belong to the War System. They are civilians in
spirit, sometimes in disguise, but permeated with ideas
of law and justice, a condition far removed from that of
the professional war maker of the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The impression of America as a great factor in international
conciliation receives impetus with the celebration
of the hundred years of Anglo-Saxon peace, with its lesson
of the unguarded and therefore perfectly defended 4,000
miles of Canadian frontier. This impression has been
strongly emphasized by the admirable skill by which
President Wilson has up to the time of this writing, honorably
avoided war with Mexico, a war which was considered
inevitable in most political circles in Europe.
While on the one hand the United States cannot have the
secret treaty, the cherished tool of the War System since
the days of Machiavelli, and while Democracy is a form
of government fitted for minding one's own business, and
for nothing else, it is recognized that the United States
must and should take the lead in conciliation and in arbitration,
as she is now taking the lead in furnishing means
for a world-wide survey of the War System, and for the
resultant propaganda for its abrogation.</p>

<h2>THE MACHINERY FOR PEACE</h2>


<p>It is understandable that Germany and Great Britain
should consider their armies, their battleships, dreadnoughts,
super-dreadnoughts, and invincibles as constituting
the chief machinery for peace. In celebrating
the twenty-fifth anniversary of his accession to the
imperial throne the Kaiser was hailed as "the true and
central factor of the past peaceful policy of Germany."
These were Lord Blyth's words, in recognizing the avowed
policy of the Emperor to preserve peace through the utmost
practicable preparation for war; and ex-President
Taft, who would refer to arbitrators even questions of
national honor, spoke of this apologist of arming for conflict
between nations as the "greatest single individual
force in the practical maintenance of the peace of the
world." The Kaiser's silver jubilee was the signal for unstinted
acknowledgment by the leading men of the world
that His Majesty's policy had preserved the peace of the
German Empire for a generation. In its exterior relations
Germany had looked too terrible to encounter, and the
romantic, warlike spirit that distinguishes the Teuton had
found vent in the service of preparation. The young Germans,
both aristocratic and bourgeois, were encouraged
by every means to train, to show, to be martial, but not to
fight. And it will be recalled that Germany refused to
discuss the limiting of armaments at The Hague only
because the Conference was not empowered to deal finally
with it.</p>

<p>In response to the Czar's call, delegations of twenty-six
Powers attended in 1899 the First Hague Conference;
forty-three Powers were represented at the Second Conference
in 1909. These gatherings formulated the world's
opinion against many of the evils of war. Their agreements
expressly forbade international bloodshed except
between the actual fighting forces. They made it unlawful
to sack cities, to take or destroy private property on
land, or to menace the peace and safety of non-combatants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Those who observe that the nations have not yet agreed
to do away with war overlook the fact that the non-combatant
millions within belligerent nations may not be
molested in lives or property, save that they must bear the
war's financial burdens. With respect to most of the
civilized dwellers of earth the sword is forever sheathed.
Among the fighters, too, wounds are quickly bound, and
quarter is expected and given.</p>

<p>The machinery of peace governing this world society is
not complete. It provides a way of peaceful settlement of
disputes by arbitration. It lacks a court such as that
whose decisions, backed by police and the more potent
sentiment of the people, guard the king's peace in civilized
communities. But arbitration has done much to keep
the peace of nations. The experience of the United States
is in point. Up to the time of the Second Hague Conference
Mr. John Bassett Moore finds records of more than
sixty arbitrations, the tribunals sitting with overlapping
terms of years that aggregate a hundred and twenty-five&mdash;exceeding
in number the years of this nation's life. The
total cost of these tribunals was doubtless much more
than would have been the expense of an actual court kept
always in session.</p>

<p>Before The Hague Conferences, the American Government
had already been participating in what was tantamount
to a permanent tribunal of arbitration. The questions
adjusted were of every class, not merely pecuniary
claims, but questions affecting what are called "vital interests
and national honor." The case of the Creole, for
instance, brought the United States and Great Britain
close to war, and later, in 1842, nearly caused a rupture of
the conferences between Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton&mdash;a
rupture which would almost inevitably have
led to hostilities. The case came before a tribunal of arbitration
in 1853, and was so quietly disposed of that the
public paid no attention to the award. Then there was
the negotiation of the Alabama Claims by Hamilton Fish.
Lord John Russell answered our proposal to Great Britain,
that it involved the honor of Her Majesty's Government,
of which it alone was guardian, and the claims were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
subject to arbitration. After being examined and critically
formulated, they were eight years later submitted
to the tribunal at Geneva, and settled. Mr. Roosevelt,
opposing President Taft's treaties of arbitration with
Great Britain and France, objected that they would embrace
"questions of vital interest and honor." Perhaps he
had not studied the cases of the Creole and the Alabama.</p>

<p>The values involved in American arbitral proceedings
have been enormous. More than a thousand claims were
adjusted in cases of the United States against Mexico in
1868, and a thousand more counterclaims of Mexico were
disposed of under one commission, the total amount involved
being well over half a billion dollars. And the
arbitral awards of the tribunals in which America participated
have in every case been final. Not one of the
awards to which the United States has been a party but
was carried into effect by both Governments concurrently.
In rare cases new facts discovered have reopened the proceedings,
but on such occasions the parties proceeded to
end them in a spirit of justice and equity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was to nations trained in self-restraint that the Russian
Emperor addressed his rescript of August 24, 1898,
recognizing the fact that the preservation of peace had
been put forward as the object of international policy.
More terrible engines of destruction were being wrought,
and the intellectual and physical strength of the nations,
with their labor and capital, were diverted from their
natural uses and wasted. Economic crises threatened the
world because of war preparations, the while sentiment
against war's devastation found concrete embodiment in
arbitrated disputes. A conference was proposed to limit
armaments, to prevent armed conflicts, and to mitigate
the atrocities of war. The twenty-six nations that met at
The Hague on May 18, following, codified the international
laws of war and peace already existing. Delegates
of the forty-three nations that met in the Second Conference
on June 15, 1907, amended and strengthened these
codes, added to them, and appointed the meeting of the
Third Conference, to be held in 1915.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first two Conferences the rights and duties of
neutrals were defined, the employment of force for the
recovery of contract debts was renounced, and it was laid
down that the "right of belligerents to adopt means of
injuring the enemy is not unlimited." The bombardment
of undefended towns was prohibited, together with the
discharge of projectiles from balloons, the use of bullets
that expand or flatten in the human body, the poisoning
of wells, pillage, violation of "family honor," confiscation
of private property, the laying of automatic contact mines
that do not become speedily harmless, the seizing of submarine
cables, destruction of monuments and works of
art, and interference with religious customs. The killing
treacherously of individuals belonging to the hostile nation
or army or of those who have surrendered was outlawed
and it was forbidden to make improper use of a flag
of truce, or of the national or military colors of the enemy,
or of the Red Cross badges.</p>

<p>The progress in these agreements reached by the Second
Conference is notable, in that it forbade that the rights
and acts of a member of the hostile nation be abolished,
suspended, or regarded as inadmissible in a court of law;
that a belligerent compel a man to fight against his own
country, even though he were in the belligerent's service
before the war broke out, or to force the inhabitants of
seized territory to give information about the army of the
other belligerent, or about its means of defense. While
all appliances for transmission of news and for transport,
whether by land, sea, or air, may be seized, together with
depots of arms and all munitions of war&mdash;even if belonging
to private individuals&mdash;they must be restored when
peace is made, with due award of damages. The inhabitants
of a territory are to be regarded as belligerents only
if they "carry arms openly," and that is to be the test of
their belligerency. Besides all this, the rights of prisoners
of war are sedulously guarded.</p>

<p>This code, relating to the laws and customs of war, received
what many critics of the Conferences regard as an
undue amount of attention; it was even charged that,
in effect, it legitimatized war. It did quite the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Francis Lieber drew up for President Lincoln in the second
year of the American civil war rules, which Lincoln ratified
and promulgated in the famous General Orders No. 100&mdash;the
first code regulating the conduct of armies in the field.
The international convention drawn by the Brussels Conference
of 1874, had its origin, as acknowledged by its
President, Baron Jomini, in these rules of Lieber and of
President Lincoln. To the United States honor is due, not
for legitimatizing war between nations, but for beginning
to restrict its operations to the actual fighters and their
works of attack and defense. At The Hague the work of
the Brussels Conference became in turn a basis for reaffirming
this principle, and for restricting more closely the
field of combat.</p>

<p>Moreover, the principles of the Geneva Red Cross Convention
were adapted to naval war. Machinery for rescue
and treatment of the sick, wounded, and shipwrecked men
of the world's navies was provided.</p>

<p>An International Prize Court was established, which,
in the opinion of Elihu Root, should later develop into the
court of justice for the nations. The only obstacle to
ratifying the convention for this court was swept away by
the code of laws of naval war embodied in the Declaration
of London, and drawn in February, 1909, by delegates of
the European Powers and the United States. The liability
to capture of the merchant ships of belligerents
throws their commerce largely into the hands of neutrals.
Efforts to prevent neutrals from trading with the enemy
follow. Then blockades, searches, and seizure of contraband
goods stir up strife with other nations, and give
occasion for general war. The American war of 1812 with
Great Britain resulted from such causes, the effects of
which, again, the two nations barely escaped during our
Civil War; and the sinking of British merchantmen by
Russia during its war with Japan provoked strong resentment.
Excepting two questions, those respecting the conversion
of merchant ships into warships on the high seas,
and as to whether the nationality or the domicile of the
owner shall be considered in determining "enemy property,"
the London declaration embodies clear and definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
rules on which the International Court of Prize may
render just decisions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The measures for restricting the field of actual war
were accompanied at The Hague by the erection of machinery
for the pacific settlement of international disputes.
That was work of prevention, and it was in four parts.</p>

<p>In the first part the contracting Powers agree to "use
their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement of international
differences."</p>

<p>The second provides that proffers of good offices and
mediation by a third State, never shall be regarded as unfriendly.
Throughout the Turko-Italian and Turko-Balkan
Wars, and during the Inter-Balkan conflict, the
European Powers acted as mediators under this provision,
and smoothed the way to peace.</p>

<p>The third part provided for international commissions
of inquiry, such as were comprehended in President Taft's
proposed treaties of arbitration with Great Britain and
France, and Secretary Bryan's proposed treaties with the
Central American republics and with the Powers of Europe
and Asia. The intent of these commissions is to investigate
the causes of complaint and publish them, trusting to
international public opinion to accomplish a just settlement.
This machinery worked to bring about the voluntary
payment by Russia of $300,000 damages for the
destruction of British fishing boats, fired on mistakenly
by Admiral Rozhdestvensky in his ill-fated expedition
against Japan. Again, the report of a commission on the
French steamer Tavignano, seized by the Italian torpedo
boat Fulmine during the Turko-Italian War, and concerning
the attack on the Tunisian mahones Kamouna and
Gaulois, was accepted July 23, 1912, and referred for the
final solution of equities to The Hague Court of Arbitration.</p>

<p>This court&mdash;the fourth instrumentality&mdash;is composed
of three distinct bodies; namely, the Permanent Administrative
Council, the International Bureau, and the Court
of Arbitration proper. The Permanent Council is made
up of the diplomatic envoys of the signatory Powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
accredited to the Netherlands, besides the Dutch Minister
for Foreign Affairs, and was constituted after its ratification
by nine of the Powers. The Council is permanent in
the sense that its members are always at The Hague; it
controls the International Bureau, appointing its staff and
methods of administration, and reporting the proceedings
of the court to the signatory Powers.</p>

<p>The International Bureau receives all the documents
and stipulations in disputed cases, where arbitration is
agreed upon and referred to The Hague, acting as a board
of registry. It places its staff at the disposal of tribunals
of arbitration, and occasionally of those not constituted
at The Hague, and its expenses are paid by the Powers.</p>

<p>The Court of Arbitration proper is really an "eligible
list" of individuals, "of recognized competence in questions
of international law, enjoying the highest moral
reputation," designated by the forty-four Powers signatory
to the convention. Their terms are six years, renewable,
not over four members appointed by a Power. Their jurisdiction
extends over all cases submitted to them, but
sometimes the parties agree to a special tribunal not
selected from the list. Two names may be selected from
the list of arbitrators by each of the Powers in dispute, and
the amended convention of 1907 provides that only one
of these can be its envoy or chosen from its nominees to
the Court of Arbitration. The four arbitrators thus
selected themselves choose a fifth as umpire, or, if the votes
of the four are equally divided, the choice of umpire is
intrusted to a third Power to be agreed upon. If there is
failure to agree upon a third Power, each party to the controversy
makes a separate choice of a Power, and the two
thus selected will try to appoint the umpire. But if they,
in turn, fail to agree, each shall within two months' time
present two candidates from the general list, excluding
those selected by the disputants or of their nations; by lot
among these, the umpire is finally elected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work of the Third Conference, besides adding to
the statute law of war, will largely concern the regulations
governing the Court of Arbitration. Since it was constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
in April, 1901, this court has passed judgment in
fourteen important cases without having established
needed rules of practice. It is not decided whether the
cases and counter-cases shall be presented with argument,
or merely with statements of the facts, the conclusions
sought, and the proofs. The practice is both ways. The
thirty-five articles relating to "arbitral procedure" fail to
prescribe rules, leaving this task to the tribunal in each
case. As a result the terms of procedure in the Casablanca
dispute, for instance, which were decided hastily to avert a
threatened war, were brief and vague, and they left the
discretion of the tribunal uncontrolled. The order of oral
debate is not determined chiefly because a disputant is
touchy about being classed as plaintiff or defendant.
Clear rulings on points of practice are not made when
presented, although the agents and counsel are entitled
by the rules to "present orally to the tribunal all the
arguments they may consider expedient in defense of their
case." Yet opportunity to argue a motion is sometimes
not afforded when the motion is made, and an argument
presented later would be out of place. It would aid procedure
to have arguments presented and rulings made as
the points come up. Finally, the informal discussions between
court and counsel frequently hinder the straightforward
presentation of a case.</p>

<p>But the chief defect of these arbitral tribunals, as in all
others&mdash;for practice has not reached the perfection of
choosing disinterested judges belonging to nations not
concerned in the controversy&mdash;lies in their temptation
to compromise. Gallatin, in the Northeastern Boundary
case with Great Britain, remarked that the arbitrator
"has always a bias to split the difference." The Casablanca
case, the decision of which really did avert war, and
more than any, so far, justifies the establishment of the
world court, depended on law and fact, but was compromised.
Dr. Heinrich Lammasch, a distinguished member
of several Hague tribunals, speaks of the "preponderatingly
diplomatic character" of this decision. Other decisions
have been criticised for the same reason, notably
those of the North Atlantic Fisheries and the Orinoco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Steamship. Compromise, while of value, is the function
of diplomacy or mediation, and the cases referred to The
Hague are admittedly those which diplomacy cannot adjust.
The remedy is by direct agreement to exclude from
the tribunal judges who sit as diplomatic agents of their
governments. A beginning in this direction is in Secretary
Bryan's plan for commissions of inquiry, consisting
of five members, three of whom should be chosen from
other countries than those in dispute. But these would
be merely committees. The defect of Mr. Bryan's plan,
and the great lack of the Hague Court of Arbitration, is
that the agreements to refer cases in dispute are purely
voluntary; the one thing for friends of peace to work for,
of course, is to make it as easy for differing nations as for
differing men to hale each other into court, and as impossible
to refer their differences to force.</p>

<p>The International Court of Prize has already come
nearer to this ideal than the Court of Arbitration. It is a
regular court of justice. Its judges are not arbitrators,
they receive a fixed compensation, their jurisdiction in
cases of appeal from the national prize courts relating to
captured merchant ships and cargoes, is compulsory. In
absence of treaty provisions between the states in dispute,
the convention adopted by the Second Hague Conference
reads, "the court shall apply the rules of international
law; if no generally recognized rule exists, the court shall
give judgment in accordance with the general principles
of justice and equity." Before ratifying the convention,
Great Britain in 1908 called a conference in London of the
chief naval Powers, which codified the laws of naval war,
covering blockades, contraband, service ill-becoming neutrals,
destruction of neutral prizes, transfer to a neutral
flag, hostile character, convoy, resistance to search, and
compensation. Here a whole category of cases is at once
removed from the judgment of biased minds.</p>

<p>The existing Court of Arbitration may be resorted to
increasingly as a means of diplomatic conciliation; but by
its side and above it should rise, in the opinion of all authorities
on international law, a Supreme Court of Arbitral
Justice, not diplomatic but judicial, that will render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
its decisions rigorously according to the declared law and
the evidence. The Second Conference at The Hague approved
a convention for the establishment of such a court.
The United States has proposed to the Powers that the
Prize Court be invested with the functions and jurisdiction
of a Court of Arbitral Justice. The practical difficulty
met at The Hague was in the appointing of permanent
Judges. Forty-four, one for each state including The
Netherlands, would be too many. A court of but fifteen
Judges was recognized as desirable. Such a court could
not be chosen from forty-four nations, and the delegates
were in a quandary. The arguments were irrefragable, of
course, that a small, independent body of magistrates
selected in advance is needed to settle controversies between
nations as they arise, and as a court of appeal from
the decisions of temporary tribunals. Such a tribunal
might well become a court of first as well as of last resort,
because of the difficulties and delays usually experienced
in making up the mixed arbitral commissions from the
eligible list of the Court of Arbitration. The alternative
recourse is especially needed when the imminence of war
requires a speedy reference, as in the Casablanca case.
For these reasons the convention was drawn and approved,
leaving to the Third Conference the task of constituting
the court. Ernest Nys, a member of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration and Counselor of the Court of Appeals of
Brussels, urging the necessity of such a tribunal, makes
the point that its members should not be chosen to represent
any countries, as such, but rather in a way to assure
that the different systems of law and procedure, as well as
the principal languages of the world, might be represented.
By this means the world peace may be permanently established.
Organized justice will succeed arbitration,
guaranteeing to individuals and states the security of their
rights and institutions, precisely as the "king's peace"
had come to guarantee them within the limits of each
sovereignty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this review of the instruments making for peace by
conciliation and law, the arguments for war have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
ignored. If at The Hague in 1915 the Powers should decide
to nationalize the private industries that supply armaments
and engines of war, the artificial stimulus given to
those industries and the exploitation of new appliances for
war would cease; manufacturers would no longer oppose
the limitation of armaments, which every nation desires.
Complete preparation for war did not prevent the Balkan
States and Turkey, not yet emerged from the civilization
of the Middle Ages, from coming to the death grip with
each other. It was different with those nations whose
Council of Ambassadors, sitting in London, and watching
the kaleidoscopic changes in the Balkans, became by the
statesmanlike influence of Earl Grey, a clearing house,
through which the affairs of the six chief Powers were adjusted
to a harmonious ending. It is noteworthy that in
the more than forty years of Europe following the close
of the Franco-Prussian war&mdash;perhaps as good as a cycle
of Cathay&mdash;those six Powers, though armed for provocation,
have by such careful negotiations remained at peace.
But making the allowance due to this remarkable abstention
from war, to which must be added the hundred
years of peace between the United States and Great
Britain, the inherent appeal of war to the imagination and
emotions of mankind must still be recognized.</p>

<p>War's mutilations have never roused aught but horror,
its waste of men and treasure are deplored. But the spirit
of strife, of daring, and of heroism remains in human
breasts. If war is outworn, if bloodshed and sacrifice of
lives are to cease between civilized states, as they have
long ceased within those states, it must be that better
means have been found to satisfy the profound human
need of expression and of conquest. The German Emperor,
while keeping up the medieval pageantry of arms,
has welded his nation into a militant power of industry
and science. Their arts are not ignoble, their industries
are not monotonous, but have taken on the aspect of imperial
enterprise and daring. Their scientists are rescuing
mankind from disease and freeing it from menial labors,
while their merchants and traders are modernizing the
orient, setting examples of method and discipline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
incidentally, to their rivals in the civilized nations. It is by
such means that civilization need no longer rear itself on
human slavery; the very beasts of burden have been freed,
and man has seized control of nature's forces. By them
he is borne through cities, manners, climates, councils,
governments, more swiftly than Ulysses went, and beyond
the paths of all the western stars.</p>

<p>More distant horizons of science have been opened. The
transmutation of the elements, but recently announced, is
expected to realize more than the dreams of the alchemist.
If we are to believe Professor Soddy, who with Sir William
Ramsay obtained in 1903 the first direct proof that radioactive
processes are veritable transmutations, this discovery
in its consequences should "absolutely revolutionize
the whole condition of existence." For of all processes,
this alone accounts for the wealth of energy dissipated so
prodigally throughout the universe over apparently endless
periods of time. Once means are found to accelerate
the transmuting rate of radioactive atoms, Professor Soddy
believes the same means will suffice to break up the other
elements now unchanging, releasing energy which man
may harness a "million times greater than any at present
utilized." In his masterly address in 1908 before the
American Society of International Law, Elihu Root traced
the development of the international spirit by the use of
human inventions conquering space and time. Clans,
communities, nationalities have lost their early function,
and frontiers and territorial possessions are changing their
political significance. Terrestrial pioneering is not ended,
the continents are rediscovering each other in new relations.</p>

<p>Much has been done to open new channels for the play
of men's energies away from war. War has had its uses to
break up the old order, to let loose new and unknown forces
in society, to set men free from tradition. That was the
great work of the Crusades. Chivalry and knighthood
are still needed, but of a new order. The martyrs for
aerial navigation are the type. The machinery for peace
that has been set up in the new palace at The Hague
will not confine the adventurous spirit of mankind.</p>

<h2>EN CASSEROLE</h2>


<h3><i>Tobacco and Alcohol</i></h3>

<p>As to tobacco, since reading the article on it in
this number, this Review has really thought more
seriously than ever before about (not <i>of</i>) giving up smoking.
But many doctors here and in Europe have told us
to keep on, and but one has told us to stop. How is it
with you? We wonder whether life with tobacco <i>can</i> seem
to those who know only life without it, as bad as life without
it seems to those who have known life with it! Perhaps
each class should experiment in the other's field.</p>

<p>As to the outlay for mere pleasure, and the destruction of
life involved, we wonder how those caused by tobacco would
compare with those caused by travel&mdash;short trips as well
as long, by carriage, automobile, vessel&mdash;and aeroplane?
Our contributor has seen these paragraphs, and he says,
very much to our edification and entertainment:</p>

<p>"It is a relief to know that the tobacco article is not going
to interfere with the pleasure which 'This Review' derives
from smoking. But the writer confesses to a little
surprise at the precocity of an infant which in its first
year has acquired the nicotine habit to such an extent as to
lead it to consult several physicians on the subject."</p>

<p>[It is many years since, but we remember that in at
least two cases, the prescription was <i>volunteered</i>. Ed.]</p>

<p>"As for the expense caused by driving for pleasure, our
statistics do not give us a conclusive answer, but they at
least supply us with an outside figure, for Uncle Sam in
counting his horses at the time of the last census distinguished
between those on farms and those elsewhere. It
is fair to assume that the great bulk of the horses used for
pleasure are in the second class, and that they constitute
a comparatively small fraction of that class. Now horses
not on farms numbered 3,182,789 in 1910, and were valued
at $422,204,393. In other words, a third of what smokers
spend for tobacco would enable them to buy up all of the
horses in a big class, only a fraction of which is used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
pleasure, and an equal amount would probably suffice for
their keep.</p>

<p>"In the case of automobiles, it is still more difficult to
distinguish between those used for pleasure and those used
for directly productive or public purposes. However, the
object of the article was to call attention not so much to
gross figures of expenditure, as to the indirect burden imposed
by smokers upon the community at large. The
automobilist who is willing to run down innocent wayfarers
rather than curb his craze for speed is in the same class
with the smoker who so smokes as to destroy property and
life. Indeed the two are often identical, and it was no
mere accident that led the Massachusetts Forestry Association
to depict upon its poster designed to stop forest
fires, a party of smoking automobilists bowling along and
leaving a trail of fire behind them. If the 'Review' can
devise some painless way of eliminating both the reckless
smoker and the reckless joy-rider from the landscape, it
will kill two undesirable birds with one stone."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And as to alcohol. Well! There's Horace and Schiller
and the feast of Cana, and the whiskey Lincoln wanted for
his other generals, and lots of other people and facts.</p>

<p>But as to bar-maids, we are bound to say that since the
graceful tribute to them on earlier pages was in type, there
has been placed in our hands evidence of a crusade against
their employment in England, and of its abolition by law
in South Australia. See the Memoir of Margaret Ethel
Macdonald. London, 1913.</p>

<p>For all we know, the preponderance of argument may
be against the substitution of women for men as barkeepers;
but we suspect that at least it would diminish
the shooting at and by barkeepers, in New York.</p>

<p>And another thing we think we do know&mdash;that in these
progressive days, it would be hard to find any pursuit in
which women are engaged, where there is not agitation to
improve it off the face of the earth. Their old-fashioned
pursuits of wife and mother have lately been specially
honored by such agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Answering Big Questions</i></h3>

<p>A contemporary that we have always very highly
"esteemed" (we believe that is the correct term, but we
are new in the profession) is now proceeding to fill us
with awe. It announces that it is going to circulate
privately among its friends, a series of brochures that
"will answer big questions." We wish we could do that;
but our cotemporary has already engaged the only editor
we know of who can. For our poor part, we are apt to
encounter in any country grocery some question too big
for us to answer. But the answers our esteemed cotemporary
is going to send out may occasionally help us in
telling how a big question that we don't profess to be
able to answer, looks to us. We have already had some
help of this kind from the editor in question: on many
subjects his glowing imagination has thrown such high
lights that we have found places of shadow before unsuspected.</p>

<p>The matter reminds us of Horace Greeley's proposition
to issue "for the people," a series of pamphlets for five
cents each, to contain only "the pure truth." He did not
say where he was going to get it.</p>


<h3><i>Decency and the Stage</i></h3>

<p>In the present agitation regarding decency on the stage,
it is probably safe to assume that the proponents for license
or liberty or freedom or whatever they call it, admit
that there are <i>some</i> necessary acts and places which should
not be represented on the stage. Now would it not clarify
discussion if the said proponents were to draw the line
between such inadmissible matters and those that should
be admitted? We have never happened to see such a line
drawn.</p>


<h3><i>What Is the Matter with the American Colleges</i></h3>

<p>Everybody in every one of them seems to know that
something is the matter, but nobody in any seems to
know just what, much less, then, a remedy for whatever
it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Some say it is the suppression of the individual, the
glorification of the average. Others say it is college yelling
and athletics. Yet others, that it is vocationalizing and
the deadly practical. Still others call it the proletariat of
the doctorate, the fad of the faculties for immature or
imitation research.</p>

<p>Can it be that it is all these things and several more, particularly
all those that exist in contrasted pairs, such as
discipline and required work according to the standard of
the mean, and at the same time, elective studies and the
freedom of the city? Or simultaneous college yells and
doctor's dissertations. And can it be that all these grow
out of a single actual condition which is common to all
American higher education, and which compels it to be
"lower" at the same time that it is "higher"? For in the
present organization of practically every American college
and university that condition actually does exist.</p>

<p>It exists by virtue of the fact of the housing in the same
dormitories and fraternity houses, and mixing in the same
class rooms and laboratories, and providing with the same
teachers and deans, and ruling by the same regulations
and gum-shoe committees, of dependent preparatory students
and independent advanced students.</p>

<p>Our high schools stop short of finishing the preparation
of students for University work. Our universities assume
part of the high school function along with their own.
The German <i>Gymnasium</i> and French <i>lycée</i> include the
equivalents of the American college Freshmen and part
of the Sophomores. They finish up the drill and discipline
stage of education. The Continental university begins
and carries on the stage of intelligent and self-chosen and
independent work. But in the American universities there
must be discipline, college yells, drill in routine and elementary
work, classes handled on the basis of averages,
and teachers of the <i>Gymnasium</i> and <i>lycée</i> type, existing
side by side with recognition and encouragement of the
individual freedom of bent, disregard of credit hours and
assigned tasks, and scholarly professors and investigators
of real university type.</p>

<p>The outcome is that the drill teachers are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
pseudo-investigators; the investigators made unwilling drill
teachers. The students are invited to soar, and at the
same time ordered to march in ranks. Preparatory school
rules are made for the sake of the Freshmen, which the
Seniors have to obey. Freedom of choice in study is
offered because of the Seniors and graduates, to the utter
demoralization of the Freshmen.</p>

<p>Because of this impossible juxtaposition of discipline
and freedom, drill and inspiration, the American university
feels sick. It knows very well that something is the
matter with it. It has to be all things to all students, and
is, in fact, too little of a real thing to any of them.</p>


<h3><i>Wanted: Proportionate News</i></h3>

<p>The most noteworthy difference between European and
American Journalism, as regards news, is the prominence
we give to what is technically called the news of the
day. Let a great liner be sunk or saved and all the
newspapers, even the most conservative, print page on
page of repetitious story or comment, playing on the emotions
from every point of view. No European paper would
feature even the most affecting news on any such scale.
Doubtless our American practice is a natural enough tribute
from the editors to the mobility of our sympathies,
not to say the flightiness of our minds. What the enthralled
reader does not realize is that to provide him with
the completely modulated thrill of the day scores of important
items of routine news have been curtailed to
meaningless epitome or wholly suppressed. For several
days that duty of daily chronicle which a good newspaper
ordinarily performs is intermitted. The most important
debates of a congressional year will receive bare notice so
long as a heroic Marconi operator is in the public eye.
The greatest of foreign statesmen or authors might die in
the glorious interim and receive the barest notice; a revolution
in Persia would yield to a factory fire on the East
Side.</p>

<p>Now something of this disproportion is necessary. No
paper could live in America which scrupulously treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
news according to its abstract importance regardless of the
reader's cravings. Yet a journal that respects itself has a
function of daily chronicle that should under no circumstances
be suspended. A really good newspaper ought to
be valuable material for the historian, and our best newspaper
will several times in every twelvemonth leave him
badly in the lurch. For a week he will find admirable reports
of say the discussion of a very important measure like
the currency bill, and then suddenly the <i>Volturno und
kein Ende</i>. Just about the time when mail letters were beginning
to tell a certain amount of truth about the Messina
earthquake, the telegraphic reports of which were
egregious inventions of distant improvisers, <i>The Republic</i>
was saved through the intrepidity of Jack Binns. A correspondent
who had been on the ground at Messina and
remained in close touch with the rescuers and refugees
received the sufficient answer with regard to additional
earthquake facts "Jack Binns has killed Messina." Here
is obviously both a good and a bad reason. There was
every reason for celebrating at length the pluck and loyalty
of Jack Binns, and no reason for curtailing the
record of one of the greatest disasters registered in history.</p>

<p>The first duty of a good newspaper is to the more important
routine news. It is a duty that every American
journal neglects at times quite scandalously. The old fashion
of relegating striking news of the day to an extra had
much to commend it. Abuse of the extra by the yellow
press has pretty well killed the practice among the conservative
papers. Possibly a discreet revival of the legitimate
extra might help matters. But what is really needed
is a juster sense of proportion and a clearer conception of
duty among editors. With a little insight and much courage
a managing editor might make himself the controller
of the "news of the day," rather than its mere conduit.
In the long run his paper would more than gain in steady
prestige what it lost in occasional flurries of sensational
success.</p>

<h3><i>Simplified Spelling</i></h3>

<p>Rather than bother our readers and distract their
attention from what we have to say, we print in the orthographic
forms we are all accustomed to. But we realize
that many of these forms are inconsistent and irrational&mdash;more
so in English than in any other civilized language&mdash;and
that the difficulty of learning them wastes the time and
tissue of our children, and obstructs among foreigners the
spread of English to its natural position of a world language,
with the blessings that its attaining that position
would bring in peace and commerce.</p>

<p>Our orthography is, of course, an evolution. It began
with picture symbols, and some of these were gradually
changed into the letters of our alphabet. But the signs
have always been later than the sounds, and we never had
enough of the former to express the niceties of the latter.
Therefore imperfections and inconsistencies in any new
system proposed should not be fatal against it, if it is
enough of an advance on the existing system, and a better
advance than any other proposed. The orthography of
the future will undoubtedly be eclectic from many proposals,
and probably, like the present orthography, from
many involuntary and unreasoned practices.</p>

<p>The English Simplified Spelling Society, which contains
the leading British authorities, has gone on the principle
that it is not worth while to recommend any changes short
of a comprehensive scheme for the whole language, and
has recommended an approximate one. Nothing more
than approximation is possible.</p>

<p>The American Simplified Spelling Board, sustained by
Mr. Carnegie, which corresponds in authority with the
English society, has not attempted a comprehensive system,
but for the worst extravagances and inconsistencies
has simply recommended a number of remedies, especially
such forms as <i>tho</i>, <i>thru</i>, and the following changes in final
syllables&mdash;saving all silent <i>e's</i>, including the one in <i>ed</i>;
the <i>me</i> in <i>gramme</i>, and programme; the <i>ue</i> in final <i>gue</i>;
the <i>te</i> in final <i>ette</i>; also the substitution of <i>t</i> for <i>d</i> final, when
so pronounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>As is well known, several of the remedial forms are already
in considerable use, especially in advertising and
other writing where no appreciable demands are made on
the understanding or emotions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From here until we giv notis on a later page, we wil uze
som of those forms and a few more&mdash;all of which may be
not too radical for present use in informal riting, as abuv
mentioned, and may be regarded as transitional toward an
ideal system. It woud undoutedly be easier to teach
children a comprehensiv and consistent sistem than the
existing caos minus varius uncorrected partial remedies,
as illustrated in the present riting. The authoritys ar
agreed that children woud lern a consistent sistem years
qicker than the present lac of sistem, and having lernd the
consistent sistem, woud pic up the forms they find in
newspapers and existing bouks without conscius effort.
Then of course a generation familiar with a goud sistem
woud soon be suppleid with literature in it. But a rising
generation cannot be taut such a sistem before the elders
ar convinst of its utility.</p>

<p>We wish to promote such a conviction as far as we can,
but no won without experience can begin to realize the
difficultys, in fact the impossibility, of presenting new
forms with absolute consistency. Words really sound
differently in som connections than in others; and habit
asserts itself in spite of reson. In half a dozen revisions of
these paragrafs, inconsistencys hav bin found every time,
and som undoutedly remain. But such inconsistencys ar
not permanently inherent in the reform, and shoud not
prejudis it. Habits of pronunciation disagree, and even if
they did not, perfect discrimination coud not be attaind
even with an alfabet twice as large as our present one; and
if absolute discrimination wer attaind, it woud sune be
nullified by an accent in som new popular song, or from
som new popular orator. The only way to keep spelling
abrest of language is for lexicografers to cut luse from
precedent, and closely follo the actual pronunciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
their own times. William D. Whitney used to say that if
they had always don that, filological sience woud be much
farther advanst.</p>

<p>A special cause of inconsistency is the tendency to preserv
what is not very bad, and to make changes as slight
as reson wil permit, but when no slight change wil do the
tric, to make the change as goud as possibl. But see
what somtimes coms. The <i>w</i> in <i>write</i> is utterly useless.
Take it off, and we have a fairly good word <i>rite</i>. But the
<i>gh</i> in <i>right</i> is also useless&mdash;not pronounst, as is the <i>ch</i>
in the cognate German <i>recht</i>. If we get rid of it, however,
we have <i>rit</i>, which rimes with <i>fit</i>. Now take it all in all,
the best way to lengthen that <i>i</i> is to dubl it, just as in
silabls closed with a consonant we alreddy somtimes dubl
the vowel&mdash;the <i>e</i> in <i>seen</i>, the <i>o</i> in <i>door</i>. <i>This is not necessary
in open silabls.</i> The S. S. S. proposes we shal dubl
the <i>a</i> in <i>faather</i>, and the <i>u</i> in <i>tuun</i> (<i>tune</i>). Then if we dubl
the <i>i</i>, we hav a uniform sistem with the long vowels. This
givs us <i>riit</i>. But then the processes we hav just been thru
land us with <i>rite</i> and <i>riit</i> for the same sound.</p>

<p>Of course to represent a sound in more than won way
brings perplexity to spellers. Yet several ways are resonabl
to let stand until a new generation can be educated
to the best. This is a not unresonabl concession to habit,
and is not nearly so bad as to let a simbol represent more
than one sound, as in the two sounds for <i>tear</i>, and the
vowel sounds in <i>door</i> and <i>poor</i>.</p>

<p>But we must also take into account what Skeat rightly
says&mdash;that the simbol for a sound should not be distributed
in two places; and therefore <i>rite</i> is not so good as
<i>riit</i>. But the <i>e</i> at the end of a closed silabl to lengthen the
vowel, is so intrencht in the language that it woud be
doutful policy to attack it yet in words fairly fit to stand,
e. g., <i>fate</i>, <i>mate</i>, <i>bite</i>, <i>mote</i>, <i>lute</i>. So the transition policy we
recommend is to let all fairly goud forms stand, but where
a form is to bad to stand, change it into the best possibl, as
<i>right</i> into <i>riit</i>, even at the price of such an inconsistency
as leaving <i>rite</i> from <i>write</i>, because <i>rite</i> is more workabl,
tho <i>riit</i> woud be theoretically better. Som such inconsistencys
ar inevitabl, as we cannot start fresh, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
must evolv from an existing inconsistent&mdash;very inconsistent&mdash;orthografy.</p>

<p>In spelling, as in matters perhaps more important (tho
the importance of rational spelling is vastly grater than
generally realized), it is wel to recognize the ideal, but to
try to advocate at any time only what is workabl at that
time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now we proceed tu a much clooser approximashon tu an
ideal for owr children, so far az it appeerz practicabl with
the prezzent alfabet. It wil at first seem a very funny
ideal. All such approximashonz wil differ, and wil hav tu
fiit it owt, and this wun wil seem at first tu be caos and
oold niit, but allmoost enny wun ov them, tu a miind
withowt an alien training&mdash;tu a chiild's miind, woud be
moor orderly and luminus than owr prezzent sistem, or
rathther lac ov sistem.</p>

<p>The rezonz for the niu formz which ar not obvius wil be
explaind alfabetically after the text.</p>

<p>Moost ov the formz we giv ar recommended by the
S. S. B. and the S. S. S. But thair ar itemz on which theze
bodyz ar not yet agreed, even among themselvz; yet thair
laborz hav reecht the point whair individualz shoud taak
hoold and subject the formz thay beleev in tu the strugl
for existens and the survival ov the fittest.</p>

<p>The grait difficultyz ar in indicating the vowelz with
owr prezzent alfabet, which givz, for instans, oonly the
wun simbol <i>a</i> for at leest ait sowndz, and probably moor
not generaly discriminated, and the wun simbol <i>e</i> for at
leest fiiv, <i>i</i> for three, <i>o</i> for foor, and dubld for foor moor, and
<i>u</i> for fiiv.</p>

<p>The short vowelz ar dispoozd ov with comparativ eez:
for in a silabl cloozd with a consonant, the vowel iz uzualy
short, e. g., <i>bad</i>, <i>bed</i>, <i>did</i>, <i>cod</i>, <i>cub</i>, but unfortunaitly not all
short vowelz hav thair silablz cloozd. In Saxon dissilablz,
owr ancestorz generaly did clooz the first silabl
when it woz short, by repeeting the vowel beginning the
folloing silabl, e. g., <i>gabble</i>, <i>filling</i>, <i>fizzle</i>. But the practis
ov cloozing in this way woz generaly <i>restricted tu dissilabls</i>,
az the pronunsiashon ov polisilabls iz apt tu indicait itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and economy iz wurth considering. In wurdz directly
from the Latin, az thair iz les differens ov axent between
the silabls, the clozing ov the first silabl az abuv descriibd,
iz not yuzual. It woud probably be wel tu introduus it,
however. If, for instans, the first silabl wer cloozd in
<i>viggor</i>, we shoud not hav such contradicshonz az <i>vigor</i> and
<i>vizor</i> siid by siid.</p>

<p>Az tu the long sowndz, the oonly way tu reprezent them,
<i>whair thay ar not determind by pozishon at the end ov an
oopen silabl</i>, iz (az allreddy illustrated) by combining the
letrz with different letrz, az we now combiin in <i>gain</i>, <i>real</i>,
<i>mine</i>, <i>soar</i>, <i>rule</i>: evidently <i>gan</i>, <i>rel</i>, <i>min</i>, <i>sor</i>, <i>rul</i>, woud not
anser the purpus. We hav tu maik theez combinashonz
becawz the genius ov owr rais duz not seem tu favor adding
letrz tu owr alfabet, inazmuch az we hav allreddy dropt
tu valuabl wunz reprezenting respectivly <i>th</i> and <i>dh</i>.</p>

<p>It certanly woud be best, az allreddy propoozd, tu dubl
eech vowel for its long sownd, az we allreddy du in <i>deem</i>
and <i>door</i>. But we hav no exampl ov dubl <i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>u</i> (except
in tu or three forren wurdz liik <i>bazaar</i>, and ov coors, owr
utterly exentric <i>w</i>), but the S. S. S. recommendz <i>uu</i> insted
ov the <i>oo</i> in <i>coon</i>, and dubl <i>a</i> in <i>faather</i>, which we accept.
We do not need to dubl the <i>a</i> befoor <i>r</i> final in monosilabls
becawz it haz the <i>ah</i> sownd befoor <i>r</i> exept when the <i>a</i>
follooz a <i>w</i> sownd, iither in <i>w</i> itself or in <i>cw</i> exprest az <i>q</i>,
e. g. in <i>war</i> (<i>wawr</i>) or <i>quart</i> (<i>qawrt</i>). The foorgoing givz
dubl vowelz for all but <i>i</i>, and we propooz them thair. This
iz a compleet sistem baasd on a principl.</p>

<p>Now for sum explanashonz.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>abuv = above. The e final propperly maiks the <i>o</i> long, and
iz entirely owt ov plais heer and in <i>love</i>, <i>shove</i>, <i>etc.</i>
The sownd ov the <i>o</i> iz propperly a <i>u</i> sownd, az in <i>but</i>,
and iz wun ov several cases whair we absurdly yuuz
<i>o</i> tu express <i>u</i> sowndz.</p>

<p>allreddy = already. The silabl <i>al</i> propperly riims with <i>gal</i>,
<i>Hal</i>, <i>pal</i>, <i>Sal</i>&mdash;rather a riotus set ov silabls, but thay
ar whot running down the alfabet givz. And the
silabl <i>read</i> propperly riims with <i>bead</i>, and shoud be
spelt here <i>red</i>, but <i>redy</i> shoud riim with <i>needy</i>, so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
proviid an addishonal consonant, in the mood ov owr
ancestorz, az allreddy explaind. This iz at the sacrifis
ov economy, but the reformd sistemz hav uthther
economyz, espeshally in the terminal <i>ed</i>, tu compensait.
See allso <i>prezzent</i> and <i>confiuzd</i>.</p>

<p>allso = also. See <i>allreddy</i>.</p>

<p>allwaiz = always. The S. S. S. recommendz <i>ai</i> for the long
<i>a</i> sownd az in <i>pair</i>. See <i>allreddy</i>.</p>

<p>bin = been, which propperly riimz with <i>seen</i>.</p>

<p>confiuuzd = confused. Withowt the <i>i</i>, propperly pronownst
<i>confoozd</i>. Moorover we wawnt tu get rid ov
the apparent silabl at the end ov such wurdz, not oonly
tu economiiz the yuusles <i>e</i>, but allso becawz forrenerz
tend to pronowns the <i>ed</i> az a silabl.</p>

<p>coors = course and coarse. <i>oo</i> az in <i>door</i> iz the best simbol
for long <i>o</i>, az <i>ee</i> iz the best simbol for long <i>e</i>. The <i>ou</i>
simbol we reserv for such wurdz az <i>coud</i>, <i>shoud</i>, <i>woud</i>.
The temptashon tu maik coors riim with Boors, iz
ov the devvil: for Boors iz abominably spelt. It
shoud be Buurz; and furze shoud be spelt withowt the
<i>e</i>. Thair iz no serius objecshon tu making <i>coors</i> serv
for both <i>course</i> and <i>coarse</i>: thair ar allreddy menny
cases whaar wun wurd meenz several thingz.</p>

<p>determind = determined. <i>Mined</i> can propperly be pronownst
oonly with a long <i>i</i>, and the silabl or wurd
<i>mind</i>, with a short <i>i</i>. Allso see <i>confiuuzd</i>.</p>

<p>devvil = devil, which with dubl propriety riimz with <i>evil</i>.</p>

<p>duz = does, which propperly riimz with <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p>grait = great, which propperly riimz with <i>beat</i>.</p>

<p>havving = having, which propperly riimz with <i>saving</i>.</p>

<p>impruuvd = improved. Tu reprezent a <i>u</i> sownd with <i>o</i> iz
absurd. Allso see <i>confiuuzd</i>.</p>

<p>litl = little. Thair iz so litl vowel sownd in the last silabl ov
this and menny uthther wurdz as tu be hardly wurth
expressing, and thair ar menny difficultyz in duing it.</p>

<p>maid = made. Thair iz no objecshun to this from owr allreddy
havving a wurd <i>maid</i>. See <i>allwaiz</i>, also <i>coors</i>.</p>

<p>menny = many, which propperly and suggestivly riimz
with <i>zany</i>.</p>

<p>no = know: the S. S. B. touk off the <i>w</i>, but after chainging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<i>knock</i> into <i>noc</i>, bawkt at this <i>k</i>. We ar a litl moor
venchursum. <i>The o iz long by pozishon at the end ov
an oopen silabl.</i></p>

<p>nu = knew. See <i>no</i>.</p>

<p>oonly = only, which woud propperly riim with <i>sonly</i> if
thair wer such a wurd for filial. The S. S. S. recommendz
<i>oe</i> for the long <i>o</i> sownd, but <i>oo</i> iz betr, and we
rigl it in az an inishal after the manner of <i>eels</i>.</p>

<p>owr = our, which propperly riimz with iither <i>pour</i> or <i>tour</i>.
The vowel sownd in <i>our</i> iz that in <i>owl</i>.</p>

<p>practis = practice. In <i>practiced</i> we pronowns the <i>ed</i> az <i>t</i>,
and thairfor shoud spel it so. But if we maid it
<i>practict</i>, the <i>c</i> woud be hard. Chainging the <i>c</i> to <i>s</i> in
the parent wurd givs us <i>practist</i>, which iz wel simboliizd.</p>

<p>prezzent = present, which propperly riimz with <i>decent</i>.</p>

<p>pronowns = pronounce. See <i>practis</i>.</p>

<p>pronownst = pronounced. See <i>practis</i>.</p>

<p>propper = proper, which propperly riimz with <i>toper</i>. See
<i>allreddy</i>, allso <i>litl</i>.</p>

<p>purpus = purpose. <i>Pose</i> propperly riimz with <i>nose</i>.</p>

<p>reecht = reached. See <i>practis</i>.</p>

<p>riit = right. The <i>gh</i> wurdz hav that simbol cognait with the
German guttural <i>ch</i> az in <i>recht</i>, tho we du not pronowns
it. But <i>rit</i> woud riim with <i>bit</i>.</p>

<p>scollar = scholar. Booth Societyz omit the <i>h</i> in <i>ch</i> hard.
But that woud leev <i>scolar</i>, riiming with <i>molar</i>. See
<i>allreddy</i>, allso <i>litl</i>.</p>

<p>scuul = school. Dubl <i>o</i> iz abiuuzd in being maid tu reprezent
a <i>u</i> sownd. See <i>oonly</i>.</p>

<p>silabl = syllable. We du not keep the dubl l, becawz this
iz a polisilabl: see <a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a> neer bottom. In spelling,
children and forrenerz, and not thay aloon, ar puzzld
between <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>. The S. S. B. haz wiizly reservd <i>y</i>
for terminals, and we beleev in it for inishals allso
whair thay ar combiind with uthther vowelz. See
yuse and yuzed. Also see <i>litl</i>.</p>

<p>simbol = symbol. See <i>silabl</i>.</p>

<p>simboliizd = symbolized. See <i>silabl</i>. Moorover, if we wer
tu drop the <i>e</i> from <i>simbolized</i> tu prevent forrenerz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
pronownsing the apparent last silabl, thay woud be
in dainger of maiking the ending riim with whot we
hav spelt az <i>fizzed</i> and woud now spel az <i>fizd</i>. For this
rezon we need the <i>iizd</i> simbols. See <i>simplifiid</i>.</p>

<p>simplifiid = simplified. The <i>ie</i> freequently in English and
allwaiz in German haz the long <i>e</i> sownd, and in English
iz alwaiz confiuuzd with the long <i>e</i> sownd in <i>receiv</i>,
etc. Rezerving <i>ii</i> for the long <i>i</i> duz away with
that confiuzhon. Tu du away with the confiuzhon between
such wurdz az <i>believe</i> and <i>receive</i>, the S. S. B.
allreddy reservz <i>ie</i>, and the S. S. S., <i>ee</i>, which we follo.</p>

<p>sownd = sound. See <i>coors</i> and <i>owr</i>.</p>

<p>thair = their, see <i>allwaiz</i>.</p>

<p>thay = they. Not <i>thai</i> becawz <i>y</i> iz betr than <i>i</i> booth az
inishal and terminal.</p>

<p>tu = too, to and two. The absurdity of reprezenting a <i>u</i>
sownd by <i>o</i> is obvius. <i>We don't need tu dubl the u,
becauz the silabl iz oopen.</i></p>

<p>uthther = other. This iz a stumper. The inishal sownd iz
the <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>. The <i>th</i> propperly reprezents a singl consonant
sownd. Owr Saxon ancestorz had a singl letr
for it which we did badly in throing away. That letr
the Anglo-Saxons freqently yuuzd tu clooz a silabl
(see p. 221) az in siððan, <i>since</i>, and after thay began
tu yuuz <i>th</i> insted ov the ð, thay freqently yuuzd <i>th</i> for
the saam purpus, until its cumbrusnes thru it owt.
We stil yuuz the ð in filological publicashonz, tho often
allso the Greek &#952;. If we must yuuz <i>th</i>, for consistency's
saak it shoud be repeeted in <i>uthther</i>, <i>bruthther</i>,
<i>muthther</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Fortunaitly thair ar oonly a scoor ov such wurdz.
We riit of thair spelling partly az a curiosity that may
be interesting, and partly tu sho the dezirability ov
getting bac owr oold letrz. Macaulay's scuulboy nu,
if owrz duzn't, that the Greeks wer ahed ov us over tu
thowzand yeerz ago, in havving not oonly a singl
simbol for <i>th</i>, but a long <i>e</i> and a short <i>e</i>, and a long <i>o</i>
and a short <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>whot = what, which propperly riimz with <i>bat</i>.</p>

<p>woz or wuz = was, which propperly riimz with <i>gas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>wun = one, which propperly riimz with <i>tone</i>.</p>

<p>wurd = word, which propperly riimz with <i>cord</i>. Its vowel
is pronownst with a <i>u</i> sownd, which it iz absurd tu

<p>wurs = worse, which propperly riimz with <i>horse</i>. We woud
hardly pronowns <i>horse</i> az we pronowns <i>hearse</i>, tho
the latter iz allso abominabl: for <i>ea</i> propperly reprezents
the sownd in <i>dear</i>. The riit way tu spel <i>hearse</i>
iz <i>hurs</i>, and the riit way tu spel <i>her's</i> iz <i>hur'z</i>.</p>

<p>wuz or woz = was, which propperly riimz with <i>gas</i>.</p>

<p>yuus or yuuz = use. See <i>confiuuzd</i>. <i>Use</i> iz pronownst both

which we rongly spel <i>ooze</i>. Tu yuuz an <i>o</i> for a <i>u</i>

<h2>THE SOUL OF CAPITALISM</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>There is no such thing as capitalism, say the conservatives.
It is an empty sound, a curse in the
name of a false god, directed by the revolutionaries against
the world of things as they are, as they always have been
and always shall be. Capitalism is a reality, say the
radicals. It is the appropriate designation of the current
system&mdash;a vulgar, hideous system, a brute mechanism
set in motion by the energy of blind greed, a mechanism
through which human values and human lives are thrust,
to emerge smudged and flat and dead. The soul of capitalism?
Pernicious paradox!</p>

<p>Capitalism is no less a reality than was feudalism. The
capitalist employer is the most prominent figure in the
modern state, just as the knight was the most prominent
figure in the mediæval. But the order of knights did not
of itself constitute feudalism: equally characteristic was
the class of serfs. In a fundamental sense the system consisted
in the mutual relation between knight and serf.
Capitalism, in like manner, implies a class of employers
and a reciprocal and conditioning class of workers, but
as a system it consists in the mutual relation of these
classes. The conscious existence of the members of both
classes is shaped, or at least colored, by the capitalistic
relation. Not in the same way, however; for capitalism
induces one set of reactions in the minds of the employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
class, and another set of reactions in the minds of the
employed. But these diverse reactions are equally the
product of capitalism, its inevitable concomitants, its
psychical essence.</p>

<p>Capitalism is, to be sure, not the whole of modern life;
nor was feudalism the whole of the life of the Middle Ages.
In the feudal state there were classes that were not,
strictly speaking, under feudal law. Such were the clergy,
the merchants and artisans of the towns, the freemen of
the villages. Moreover, there were individuals who rose
superior to the system, such as the great feudatories, who
often assumed a regal freedom from the narrow feudal
rules. There were also elements that proved incapable of
assimilation, aliens, outlaws, mendicants. But the popular
mind, with its inveterate bent towards order and uniformity,
generalized the relation beyond the range of its
proper application. To the worldly bishop, even the
Pope was a great feudatory; to the beggar's apprentice,
his master was a species of knight. So at the present time
there are numerous elements that are incongruous with
capitalism. The independent worker and the small merchant,
the professional classes, the artists and the politicians,
are not properly governed by capitalistic rules.
The great magnates of the industrial world have won for
themselves a measure of immunity from the laws that
govern the conduct of the typical capitalist-employer.
But the predominance of the capitalistic system is evidenced
by the fact that all these non-assimilable forms
are being translated into capitalistic terms. A farm is
no longer a "holding," it is an "investment" or a "job."
A political magnate is a "boss" and his supporters are
"workers"; the political machine itself is "invested capital."
The buildings of church or school are, with increasing
frequency, described as "plant." We are beginning
to hear of "efficiency control" of college curricula; of the
"unit costs" of saving souls. Our most exalted dignitary
is "the people's hired man"; and the late King Humbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of Italy was wont to speak of assassination as a "trade
risk."</p>

<p>With due allowance for the whimsical quality of some
of the instances cited above, we must yet admit that they
indicate a general tendency to translate all current experience
into capitalistic terms. Such instances are but
indications of the collective conviction that capitalism
is the most significant fact in modern life. Why then
do our conservatives insist upon rejecting the term, upon
denying the very content of the concept? Chiefly because
those who have depicted capitalism have sketched it in
black crayon, instead of painting it in the rosy hues of
romance.</p>

<p>To speak of capitalism as endowed with a soul, is indeed
a paradox. But the conception of soul is itself paradoxical.
The man of science dispenses with it in so far as he can.
All that compels us rationally to posit the existence of
soul, is its works, good and evil. The hypothesis of a
human soul has been forced upon us by the fact that there
is in the action of man an element that transcends the
needs and purposes of the body, an element that we often
see growing into such commanding importance that it
reduces the body to the rank of mere instrument. Capitalism,
too, appears to subserve purposes that transcend
its proper ends. To what end, in profit-making, is the
destruction of personality, the corruption of the sentiment
of humanity, that the Socialists attribute to capitalism?
To the Socialists themselves capitalism appears endowed
with a soul, to whose purposes capital's immediate processes
are merely instrumental. Only, the soul is one of
unmixed evil.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Capitalism, like every other social system, implies a
class that rules and a class that is controlled. The ruling
class&mdash;<i>pace</i> those political theorists who refuse to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
that a ruling class exists&mdash;is composed of the capitalist
employers. And how do the capitalist employers differ
from any others of the masters that the world has known?
Not merely in that they possess accumulations and pay
wages in money. These are incidental facts. What is
essential is that the capitalist employers, in so far as they
are truly such, are controlled in all their active dealings
by the principle of commercialization.</p>

<p>And commercialization is a psychical phenomenon.
It is the substitution, in economic conduct, of a process
of calculation for a process of feeling and will. The antithesis
between the two processes has long been recognized
by practical men, under the form of the contrast between
"business" and "sentiment." That much maligned abstraction
of the economists, "the economic man," is
nothing but the capitalistic entrepreneur, reacting as he
must to a competitive situation. What the orthodox
economists failed to observe is that so-called "economic
conduct" is class conduct. It is confined to the merchants
and manufacturers of a competitive régime, whose daily
life consists in the manipulation of exchange values.
Employers who enjoy a monopoly, independent laborers,
and even the typical wage earners of capitalism, may&mdash;indeed,
must&mdash;permit their actions to be governed by
other motives, as well as by that of profit. But the capitalist
employer in a competitive trade is quickly taught by
bitter experience that it is not his function to judge and
choose. His business is to calculate; and the less non-economic
principles of action interfere with his decisions,
the more certain he is of success. All elements essential
to his business present themselves in the guise of exchange
values. All magnitudes, thus, are commensurate: you
compare one with the other and choose the greater. Intelligence
is required for the ascertaining of relative magnitudes.
But the calculation once made, action is determined.
Whether you are a man of strong will or weak
will, of active feelings or passive, you do not hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
when, in effect, a dollar is offered you in exchange for fifty
cents.</p>

<p>It is cool intelligence, not dominant personality, that,
under a purely capitalistic system, determines the distribution
of the seats of power. The capitalist employers
are our ruling class, but of all classes that have ever held
power, they least resemble personal rulers. They calculate,
but conditions beyond their control determine. And,
to be most successful, they must divest their calculations
of all elements that are irrelevant to profit making. If I
am a capitalist employer, operating under conditions of
keen competition, I buy no more readily from an honest
man than from a rogue, provided the rogue can give good
title to the things he sells. I hire men, Teutons or Slavs
or Latins, white, black or yellow, with a sole view to their
effectiveness for purposes of profit. I may have private
opinions on religion or politics or morals; on the use of
alcohol or opium or tobacco. But unless I can relate
such manifestations of virtues or vices to the point of
profit, I must suppress these opinions, in my active dealings
with men. It follows, then, that in all that concerns
the capitalist employer, in all that concerns his essential
rulership, he is a respecter of the liberties of men.</p>

<p>No one, it is true, is a capitalist employer, pure and
simple. In his social life, every one is likely to retain some
of his age-old prejudices, and to seek to enforce age-old
oppressions. As a business man, no one would be so
foolish as to refuse to sit in the same board of directors with
any other capable business man, Hellene or &#946;&#940;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;.
In his club life, on the other hand, many a business man
affects a patrician exclusiveness. The most Christian
business man does not refuse to deal freely with atheists,
but very likely he refuses to admit them to his house. As
a mine operator I should employ negroes as skilled or
unskilled laborers, as foremen or bosses, if such employment
were favorable to financial results. I might none
the less, as a citizen, attempt to exclude them from public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
office. In business hours, the exercise of personal, political
or religious oppression is penalized by technical inefficiency
and pecuniary loss. Out of business hours,
however, every man tends still to revert to the aboriginal
state of manhood, narrow, illiberal, obstinate, oppressive.</p>

<p>Capitalism, furthermore, is far from having attained
complete dominance, even in business affairs. Personal
whim, as a co-determinant of action, is not obsolete, but
merely obsolescent. The president of a great manufacturing
corporation of the Middle West detests cigarettes,
and has promulgated the rule that no men whose fingers
are cigarette stained shall be added to his staff. Mr. Henry
Ford intends to confine the benefits of employment in
his mills to men who are "worthy," that is, to men who
conform to certain standards of conduct that are good in
their employer's eyes. There are employers who will not
tolerate in their shops the presence of Socialists; others
who have engaged in a crusade to exterminate "knockers."
In all such cases of essentially personal discrimination an
attempt is made, however, to justify it on abstract grounds
of efficiency. Cigarette smokers, loose livers, Socialists
and "knockers" are poor workmen, assert these employers.
The assertion, we all know, is far from being universally
true. In so far as it is false, however, it is a gracious falsehood
in the light of the spirit of capitalism. It is a concession
to the principle that pecuniary considerations
alone justify an invasion of personal liberty.</p>

<p>Discrimination on personal grounds is, moreover, so
exceptional as to count as amiable eccentricity. It is
recognized as a handicap, which can be overcome only
by striking superiority in other directions. Mr. Ford
may watch over the private conduct of his employees,
because he is able to pay much higher wages than anyone
else. The manufacturing concern to which reference
has been made may discriminate against able workmen
with cigarette stained fingers, because it is efficiently
organized, and enjoys a monopoly position. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
instances are necessarily rare, and are interesting only as a
contrast to the businesses controlled strictly by the spirit
of capitalism.</p>

<p>Personal oppression may still be exercised within business
hours: but it represents an added cost, readily determined
by scientific management. The machinery for
its suppression is in motion; it cannot forever survive.
There is no equally effective machinery for the elimination
of the personal oppression that emerges out of business
hours. In one's business calculations, one regards a
social prejudice, even if it is directed against oneself, as
irrelevant to practical action, so long as it finds expression
only beyond the realm of business. A persistent slanderer
of alien races finds no difficulty in raising a loan from
a foreign banker, provided that the security he offers is
good. No element of revenge in the relations between
Parisian banks and German customers has appeared since
the Zabern incident. Indirectly, however, the social influence
of capitalistic toleration is very considerable. One
who has an alien partner may continue to cherish the
heroic myth of Anglo-Saxon superiority, but it will be
through desire for consistency, not out of conviction.
International financial forays upon weak nations, like
the late Six Power loan, have the effect of weakening many
a national prejudice. National, racial and religious prejudices
retain their pristine vitality only where capitalism
has not yet reached a high state of development. It is
in Russia and Rumania, economically backward states,
not in England and America, the most capitalistic of all,
that the policy of expelling heterogeneous elements flourishes.
It is in the Old South, still in a precapitalistic stage,
that the social gulf between the races is widest. It is on
the Pacific Coast, whose whole volume of capitalistic
industry could be overmatched by that of a city like
Newark, that detestation of an alien race rises to the rank
of a political issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Toleration and its counterpart, personal liberty, these
are the first constituents of the soul of capitalism. Capitalistic
toleration, it is true, originates in interest, and is
limited by interest. If capitalism admonishes me to tolerate
atheism in my foreman, so long as it does not interfere
with his efficiency, it equally admonishes me to extirpate
excessive piety in his person, if, for example, intervals
of ecstatic contemplation divert his attention from my
interests. Morally such toleration is vastly inferior to
that which is founded upon a broad sentiment of humanity
and a recognition of the presumption involved in the
prescribing of rules to one's fellow man. But ethical
toleration can find lodgment only in the breasts of the
chosen few. "Neither do I condemn thee." Of all the
miracles, is not this expression of toleration the greatest?
Millions upon millions have repeated the sentiment devoutly;
but to how few has it become a rule of life!</p>

<p>Capitalistic toleration, on the other hand, is a sentiment
not too refined for the most vulgar souls. Indeed, its
appeal is probably strongest to the very most vulgar;
certainly, to the most selfish. A high-minded employer
may seek to bring up his working-folk in the way they
should go&mdash;that is, his own conception of the Way. It
is the greedy materialist who says: "What do I care how
my workmen eat and drink and play, what they read,
how they vote, worship and marry? It's all one to me,
so they deliver the goods." Ethical toleration selects for
its votaries the few and the unselfish; capitalistic toleration
selects the many and the selfish. And it is for this
reason that the liberty based upon capitalistic toleration
is the broadest and most substantial of all. "City air
makes free," says the proverb. Not because the city is
the abode of choice souls, but because the city is capitalistic.</p>

<p>The struggle for religious liberty, it may be said, antedates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
capitalism. This is not wholly true; the hot beds of
religious liberalism in early modern times were the cities,
already becoming capitalistic. The Independents and
Quakers of England, the Huguenots of France, the Calvinists
of Holland, the Lutherans of Germany, represented
a germinating capitalism. If the spirit of capitalism was
not yet highly evolved, neither were the liberties sought
broadly conceived. The Charter and their own valiant
spirits won for the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay freedom
to worship God. But there was no freedom, in
Massachusetts Bay, to go forth from the Puritan settlement
and dance around a maypole. Precapitalistic freedom
meant only the removal of specific oppressions,
sometimes grave, sometimes trivial, imposed by the constituted
authorities. From the natural human disposition
to interfere in one another's affairs, to standardize humanity,
to excise variations above and below the normal,
there never was any freedom, except upon the lawless
frontier, until capitalism appeared upon the earth.</p>

<p>A class freedom! say the Socialists, and a hollow one!
That the Socialists are permitted to go up and down upon
the earth, teaching doctrines that they themselves proclaim
to be subversive of the interests of those whom they
designate as the ruling class, is sufficient evidence that
the freedom is not properly described as hollow. If Karl
Marx had appeared in the days of Charles the Great to
teach doctrines equally subversive of the existing order,
he would have found short shrift indeed. That it is a
class freedom is, however, true, in a sense. The capitalist
employer, who deals with many men in the course of his
business, must learn to tolerate many personal idiosyncracies,
and must in turn be met with toleration by many.
The forced repetition of acts of toleration tends to mold
the temperament of the capitalist employers as a class,
and to establish among them a large measure of personal
freedom. This repetition is lacking in the experience of
the worker. Dealing with one employer alone, or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
only a few employers in infrequent succession, the laborer
is less likely to appreciate the significance of the toleration
he enjoys, or to learn from the business process itself the
need of toleration towards others.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, under capitalism the laborer does undoubtedly
make gains in personal liberty which he could
not have made under earlier systems. We know what the
Spartans did with the Helots who varied above the type
of servile manhood. They assassinated them. We know
what the Romans did with slaves who thought too manfully.
They crucified them. In the long ages of serfdom
in Western Europe, what was the natural fate of the serf
who held his head too high? The commonplace facts of
his torturings were seldom regarded worthy of mention in
the Chronicles. Within the last century, however, men
have been beaten to death in Europe for daring to maintain
their preferences in mating against the wishes of their
lords.</p>

<p>Class liberty? Does it mean nothing to the Republican
mechanic in Birmingham, Alabama, that a Democratic
employer would be universally regarded as a fool for concerning
himself with the politics of his men? Does it
mean nothing to the Roman Catholic workman that he
may live for years in a Protestant community without
once encountering discrimination against him on account
of religion? Those who affirm that the liberty of capitalism,
even in its overflow to the working class, is hollow
and meaningless, can never have permitted their study or
their imagination to sound very thoroughly the depths of
human injury and wretchedness.</p>

<p>So much, however, must be granted: that the liberty
afforded the worker by capitalism has its offsets. If the
employer no longer regards himself as justified in ordering
the private life of his workman, neither does he feel responsible
for protecting the workman against the distress
accompanying sickness or superannuation, or even commercial
disorder. The worker has paid for his freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
with increased insecurity of his lot. But that the freedom
has been bought too dear, would be hard to maintain.
Let us suppose that a landowner organizes his possessions
upon a feudal plan, and invites working families to come
and serve him, yielding implicit obedience to him in all
personal matters as well as in matters pertaining to the
technique of production. In return for their ungrudging
services, let him guarantee them a sufficiency of food,
rough clothing, and rude housing, together with rights
to maintenance in disability and old age. How many
workers will make haste to attach themselves to him?
Where workers have tasted of capitalistic freedom, it is
safe to say that none would accept the offered privileges.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If capitalism had offered the working class nothing but
the crumbs of middle class liberty, the diatribes of the
revolutionaries would be not without justification. For
admittedly, liberty has been gained in far greater measure
by the capitalist employer than by the workman. But
capitalism has done vastly more for labor than this. It
has given rise to that most interesting and important of
all modern social phenomena, the solidarity of labor.
As an active, working concept, the fraternity of labor is
just as certainly a product of capitalism as is social toleration.
The latter is the soul of capitalism, as it manifests
itself in the class of employers, the former, as it manifests
itself in the class of employees.</p>

<p>To this statement a Socialist will at once take exception.
The sentiment of brotherhood, the Socialists claim,
originates in the common experiences of poverty and
hard labor. But the men at the passages of the Jordan
who slew one another over the pronunciation of Shibboleth
were doubtless manual workers, and were certainly poor.
The merciless strife between Saxon and Celt in England
was primarily between men who were all poor and workers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
The participants in the Sicilian vendettas, in the Scottish
clan struggles, in the Kentucky feuds, might well be
honored with the title proletariat, by virtue of poverty
and laboriousness of life. Fraternity is too luxurious a
plant to bloom upon a barren soil of universal labor and
poverty. Every one who reads the documents of middle
nineteenth century America is aware of the uncompromising
hostility of the American workingman toward the
distressed Irish seeking an escape from famine. Later,
there is abundant evidence of working class contempt and
hostility directed toward the immigrating workmen from
Germany and Scandinavia. Twenty years ago it was
the Dago that experienced the inhospitality of the workingmen
toward their alien brothers; today it is the Wapp&mdash;the
collectivity of unfortunates of uncouth ways and
unimaginable speech that seek refuge here from the poverty
and oppression of southeastern Europe. No middle
class worshipper of a family tree rooted in the old colonies
can hold the Wapp in more profound detestation than
do many of our recent arrivals. "Zese tam fools [the
Wapps], zey ruins zis tam counthry."</p>

<p>It is the attitude of the unions, we are told, that in the
North represents the chief obstacle to the progress of the
negro away from the menial services and the unskilled
employments. It was the working class that forced, first
Chinese, and later Japanese exclusion. It is working
class politics that demands a white Australia, and vexes
the British Empire over the question of emigration from
India. "Workingmen are brothers," say the Socialists.
Not by birth and native instincts. Not by virtue of community
in labor and poverty. If there is such a thing as a
fraternity of labor, it is begotten of capitalism.</p>

<p>An active sentiment of brotherhood, does, unquestionably,
spring up under capitalism. Differences of race
and religion dwindled to insignificance among the coal
miners in the great strike of 1904. The Lawrence and
Paterson strikes, and the strike in the copper country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
have offered abundant evidence of the growing strength
of the feeling of working class solidarity. It would be
difficult to cite a single recent strike in which men and
women of traditionally hostile races and creeds have not
coöperated with the utmost harmony and good will.</p>

<p>No one will deny that the more conscious the workers
are of the pressure of capitalism, the more rapidly does
the feeling of solidarity develop. This is the moral gain
that is afforded by labor disputes. It is a gain which is
not to be had without its cost, in the disorganization of
industry, the impoverishment of multitudes of working
families, the destruction of life and property, and the
loosing upon society of evil passions. Is the gain worth
its cost? In the opinion of many observers of our social
movement, the cost is tremendous, but few of these observers
attempt to strike a balance between cost and
gain. This is because they have failed to recognize working
class solidarity as a significant step in moral progress.</p>

<p>The development of solidarity among American workingmen
is proceeding rapidly; in other countries its progress
is not less manifest. This is true despite the fact
that the problem of creating harmony between hostile
races and religions is more serious where uninterrupted
continuity on the same soil renders easy the survival of
ancient prejudices. The hostility between Czech and
German, between Magyar and Slav, is mitigated when
the representatives of these warring races work side by
side in the same factory, oppressed by the same factory
regulations, impoverished by the same crises. Evidence
is accumulating, to prove that the internationalism of
labor is becoming a reality. It may not be true that
French workingmen are already so utterly averse to the
idea of shooting down their German brethren as the
Socialistic literature and the spokesmen of Socialist and
Labor parties would have us believe. But there is very
much more than a fervent hope in working class anti-militarism.
If French and German workmen might at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
present fail to refuse to kill one another in war, the time
is perhaps not far distant when the outcome of an international
war may be rendered problematical through the
extension of working class solidarity.</p>

<p>For the working class, solidarity is producing results
quite analogous to those produced in the class of capitalistic
employers by the pursuit of profit. Solidarity is
unthinkable without a measure of toleration. The American
trade unionist learns to tolerate the alien origin, the
broken speech and uncouth manner, the strange religion,
and the unexpected outlook upon life, of the foreign workman
who must either become a brother unionist and
faithful ally, or a scab and an enemy. And out of this
toleration is created a sphere of personal freedom from
social encroachment such as no workman of an earlier
epoch ever enjoyed. Fraternity and liberty, these are
the positive acquisitions won by labor out of the very oppression
of capitalism. Of the revolutionary trinity only
equality remains beyond the visible horizon. And even
equality may be brought nearer, if not realized, through
the further perfecting of working class liberty and fraternity.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Capitalism is material, gross, ugly. Yes, but it has a
soul&mdash;toleration, liberty, fraternity. And this, like most
souls, is not so much in being as in becoming. It is only
in the most highly capitalistic centers that even business
has partly freed itself from elements of personal oppression.
There is no state nor city in which the fraternity of
labor is more than an emerging fact. Under capitalism,
workingmen are brothers, but there is still a vast deal of
the Cain and Abel in their feelings toward one another.
Remove the pressure of capitalism at this instant, and
the lessons of fraternity would quickly be forgotten.
Relax the profit motive, and mankind would again stand
forth in its pristine narrowness and bigotry and cruelty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Conceive for a moment that the United States were now
under Socialistic management. With what spirit should
we greet the oppressed of other lands, fleeing to us for
refuge? We should probably judge of the problem in
terms of dividend and divisor: so much food, so many
mouths; let not the number of mouths be increased. To
be sure, there is an economic fallacy lurking in this syllogism;
but when has an economic fallacy ever been crushed
except by weight of a brute class interest? Our workingmen
are brothers of those of England and France and
Germany, under the pressure of cosmopolitan capitalism.
But the natural attitude of a group of Socialistic nations
toward one another will be a coveting of one another's
rich mines and fertile provinces. At least such will be
the natural attitude until fraternity, imposed by capitalism,
has descended from men's lips and entered into
their blood.</p>

<p>There is a wise saying in Karl Marx's <i>Critique of Political
Economy</i> (Preface): "No social order ever disappears
before all the productive forces for which there is room
in it have been developed; and new higher relations of
production never appear before the material conditions
of their existence have matured in the womb of the old
society." What Marx said of the material embodiment of
capitalism, we can apply to its soul. Capitalism is growing
toward liberty and fraternity. But the immense
distance we must traverse before this goal can be attained
is evidence of the vitality that remains in the system.
Were capitalism to be abolished today, the hard-won
gains of the last two centuries would vanish. But by this
very fact it is proved that capitalism cannot be abolished
today.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In its present stage of development capitalism, every
one admits, is ugly. Haste and vandalism have characterized
the work of constructing it. It is like the wall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Athens, rough stone upon hewn memorial tablets to the
dead, upon the trunks and limbs of statues of gods and
men and beasts. The feast of Our Lady of Carmel was
beautiful in Palermo; transplanted to New York, it is
grotesque. There was dignity in the demeanor of the
Lithuanian on his native soil: in the anthracite towns, the
Lithuanian is a mortar-disfigured torso, thrown heedlessly
into the courses of a rubble wall. All the mixing up of
peoples, of customs, of ideals, that an incipient capitalism
implies, produces a conglomerate that is inevitably ugly.</p>

<p>And quite apart from the ugliness of discordant combinations,
there is an ugliness originating in the very
virtues of capitalism. As we have seen, it is the tendency
of capitalism to leave human nature free in all that transcends
the narrow limits of the process of profit making.
And this would be well if, as the optimists assure us,
human nature were uniformly beautiful. Those of us,
however, who are not committed to dogmatic optimism
know that if some part of human nature is most beautiful
when unrestrained and unadorned, another part is most
seemly when well laced with stays of custom, well draped
in garments of convention. At any rate, in the initial
phase of the capitalistic liberation of human nature,
which we are now experiencing, it is an open question
whether our eyes are not more frequently offended than
regaled.</p>

<p>It is in the field of material objects, however, that the
contrasts between present capitalism and the earlier order
are most clearly visible. Time was when the man who
built a house granted to the whole community a voice in
determining its design. And the community permitted
variation from type, but only a moderate, well regulated
variation. Thus were the walled cities of the Middle Ages
governed by a harmony of construction, which gave to
each dwelling, at the very least, a beauty of use and wont.
Today in America the builder is free. If he chooses to
dwell in a Greek temple or a Gothic chapel or a Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
pagoda, there is no one to dissuade him. No one, except
perhaps an architect whose plans have been rejected or a
good citizen at large, ex-officio adviser of an unheeding
world.</p>

<p>In the economic field human conduct is narrowly ruled
and restricted by capitalism; but in the non-economic field&mdash;the
greater and more significant part of life&mdash;the
good and the evil, the beautiful and the ugly, are set free
by capitalism, to struggle for existence. Capitalism offers
no direct pecuniary rewards for virtue and beauty. Nor,
however, does it impose any penalties upon them. Did
any earlier order of society impose such penalties? To be
sure. Let us recall the contempt for the arts on the part
of militaristic Rome, the pride in illiteracy of the glittering
mediæval knight. Capitalism does not require a merchant
or a banker to become a connoisseur of art. Nor
does it require him to apologize for any such variation
from typical instincts.</p>

<p>If good and evil must thus strive in a fair field, neither
rewarded nor penalized economically, what will be the outcome?
The evil will prevail, say those who&mdash;strangely
enough&mdash;describe themselves as idealists. Most of us
refuse to engage in prophecies. But so much is clear: the
good and the beautiful that may prevail under a thorough-going
capitalism must be better and more beautiful than
the values of old time. Capitalistic freedom demands
that there must be greater variety and wealth of beauty
than an earlier order required; capitalistic fraternity
demands that charity and toleration must extend beyond
the bounds of class and race. Unless the art and the practical
ethics of perfected capitalism represent an advance
in universality, they will be thrust aside as meaningless
and worthless.</p>

<p>It is, to be sure, more difficult to establish fixed values
upon a broad basis of human life than upon a narrow one.
More difficult were the problems that confronted Euripides
the Pan-Hellene, than Sophocles the Athenian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
There is a contrast in technical perfection, between the
work of Balzac the Frenchman, and Daudet the adoptive
Parisian; between that of Kipling the imperialist, and
Bridges the Englander; between that of Ibsen the cosmopolitan,
and Björnson the Norwegian. But in all
these instances the loss in classical perfection is vastly
overbalanced by the gain in human worth. There were
poets and dramatists in Scandinavia before the days of
Holberg. They had an elaborate canon, all the rules of
which were violated by Holberg's iconoclastic cosmopolitanism.
What has become of the works of Holberg's
predecessors? No one can read them. But Holberg
was never so widely read and honored as today.</p>

<p>A broader and more liberal humanity than the world
has known before&mdash;such, after all, is the evolving soul
of capitalism. This does not indicate, however, that
capitalism will last forever, or deserves immortality.
There comes a time when the most responsive body becomes
a clog upon the soul, and should accordingly be
buried. The body of capitalism is none too responsive;
therefore we may be certain that it must, in the end, be
discarded. What the succeeding order will be, no man
can forecast. But it will not be one of unbridled individualism;
for a spirit of fraternity, transcending that
imposed by capitalism, will carry the principle of coöperation
to lengths beyond present dreams. And it will not
be Socialism; for the spirit of toleration and freedom, now
only germinating, will have attained to its full efflorescence
in institutions that guarantee a range of personal
development not compatible with the well-regimented
scheme of a Socialistic state. Capitalism will disappear;
but can we doubt that it will be honored in history as a
most significant stage in the progress of the human soul
towards liberty?</p>

<h2>A SOCIOLOGICAL NIGHTMARE</h2>

<p class="center">&#932;&#8048; &#956;&#8182;&#961;&#945; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;' &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#8054;&#957; &#913;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#948;&#943;&#964;&#951; &#946;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;.<br />
<span style="margin-left:11em;">Eur. Troad. 989.</span></p>

<p>The wise Hecuba accused the frail Helen of throwing
upon Aphrodite blame which really belonged to
no one but Helen herself. Can it be that, now the whole
world has turned sociologist, many of us are guilty of
throwing upon poor society blame that ought solely to
attach to us as would-be students of society? When
emancipated spirits give utterance to their views with
regard to the iniquities of the man-ruled world of the
past, and describe the ideal eugenic world of the future,
in which woman is to be man's superior, and the family a
new thing under heaven, one wonders how far the nature
of the views and the character of the vision are determined
by the deficiencies, and how far by the exceptional
endowments, mental and moral, of the critic and prophet.
When economists cross their scientific hearts, and assure
us on their honor as impartial students that, however
much they may regret to announce its speedy demise,
the monogamous family is a doomed institution, one is
tempted to ask whether a few shrivelling leaves of a brief
season would be reliable authorities with regard to the
condition of a large tree at its roots. To anyone who inquires
whether a metaphor or an analogy is an argument,
we will say that we have known political economists who
spoke of themselves and their work in terms indistinguishable
from those employed by students of the so-called
physical sciences.</p>

<p>We are free to confess that these perhaps inconsequential
remarks proceed from a middle aged person who is
not a sociologist, or an economist, or even an adept in the
New History. That we make any remarks at all is due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
to the fact that, as our title perhaps indicates, a little too
much sociological diet has induced in us a condition
analogous to nightmare. When a small boy of our acquaintance,
in a family not yet extinct, is afflicted with
this disorder, he invariably screams out lustily and runs
to his mother. Following his example as nearly as manners
and circumstances permit, we vent our feelings in
<span class="smcap">The Unpopular Review</span>.</p>

<p>"But who forces you, in this free country, to feed upon
sociological diet?" This hypothetical question from
a hypothetical reader admits of an easy reply. It is
impossible to earn one's living pent up in a barricaded
study, reading Greek; and outside of such a fastness, how
can one escape the amateur sociologist? He intrudes
himself into your most select circle at your club. He, or
she, sends you through the mail notices of "thon's" books
and lectures. He preaches at you if you go to church,
and you make him an excuse for staying away. He assails
your ears at college commencements. He makes the
<i>Congressional Record</i> duller. He solicits your vote for
this and that candidate, on the ground that they are
advocates of a new freedom, or exponents of a progressive
social and political movement, or, at the very least, stanch
friends of the people. He writes editorials and letters
in your morning and evening newspapers, and articles
in your favorite magazine. He punishes you for your
weakness in attending a public dinner. He&mdash;or rather
she&mdash;airs his&mdash;or rather her&mdash;most advanced ideas when
you are just beginning to sip your afternoon cup of tea,
and you are fortunate if, in your disgust, you do not play
havoc with the china of your hostess. Avoid sociological
diet in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred
and fourteen? It was far easier to avoid the Plague in
the year sixteen hundred and sixty-five.</p>

<p>We admit frankly that the amateur sociologist is not
the only person our weak nerves dread. We avoid a
Pragmatist and a New Realist almost as assiduously, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
with but slightly more success. Latter-day novelists,
poets, statesmen, and educators, "uplift-men" in general,
and advocates of scientific efficiency in particular,
preachers of social service who blandly assume both that
society wants their services and that they have services
to render, when what is chiefly apparent is their own need
of education&mdash;these and other sons of thunder too
numerous to mention have given us many a bad quarter
of an hour. But it is the amateur sociologist alone who is
able to give us a nightmare.</p>

<p>We confess that such was not always the case. We
entered one of the first classes ever taught in this country
in what was then called the Science of Society. We listened
with amused interest, possibly with profit, to the
remarks, interspersed with puns, which the erudite professor
allowed himself to make on the subject of marriage
as an institution. Later we read ponderous books on this
topic and kindred ones, and we even plumed ourselves
upon our advocacy of woman suffrage and our practical interest
in organized philanthropy. Political economy and
history were not neglected by us, and so we rounded out
the last century cherishing the delusion that we were
somewhat progressive. Alas, we were primitive enough
to spell it with a small "p." And now, but a few short
years later, we are wailing in or about a Sociological
Nightmare! Is it that, in the natural course of things,
we have merely become conservative, have been caught
up with, and passed, by a more radical generation, and
are taking out on them, regardless of justice and of shifting
metaphors, a spite caused by our own weakness of
mental digestion?</p>

<p>Perhaps so, perhaps not. Thus far we have not flung
even the tiniest of stones at the important study known
as Sociology, nor have we meant to hit any of its serious
students. The banner under which we enlisted as the
humblest of privates, we still salute, and as the army of
workers marches on, we, droppers-out yet loyal, raise our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
feeble cheer. But behold! we are caught in a frantic mob
of camp-followers, and we struggle in vain to extricate
ourselves. And what a mob it is! Men and women who
call themselves "Progressives" without being able to
read a pedometer; anarchists who, with less sense than
bulls, mistake a red flag for a new Gospel; propagandists
of peace who have no respect for rest; advocates of nostrums
who actually resent being called quacks; women
who rejoice in being "hikers;" philanthropists who are
doing their foolish best to make the under dog a mad one;
lecturers who convert their lungs into cash; fashionable
women who open their drawing-rooms to cranks, and their
heads to whims;&mdash;but why attempt an impossible description?
It seems better to fall back upon Matthew
Arnold's more decorous expression of his feelings, in
<i>Bacchanalia; or, the New Age</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thundering and bursting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In torrents, and waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carolling and shouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over tombs, amid graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! on the cumbered plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clearing a stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattering the past about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes the new age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bards make new poems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinkers new schools,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Life is their prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth with their deeds they fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill with their cries.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Have we, then, got at the root of the matter? Tired
out with "strenuosity," fatigued with American "progress,"
dinned with lectures, conferences, civic forums,
and all the other modes of vociferous self-expression dear
to this Age of Talk, are we, like the poet, the poet who, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
it remembered, wrote of Sophocles that he "saw life
steadily, and saw it whole," are we really longing for an
impossible golden reign of universal silence, and, in despair
of obtaining it, railing at what happens for the moment
to be the most noisy object within our dyspeptic
range of hearing&mdash;the amateur sociologist?</p>

<p>We are not sure that this is not the case, but why should
we undertake to analyze our own feelings? The main
point is that we feel them; the next point, almost as important
to ourselves, is that we want to express them.
And who that is past fifty is not warranted in indulging
in mild objurgations when it is possible to overhear at a
dinner party, as the dominant note of an eager conversation
between a lady and a gentleman, that latest intruder
into the limited vocabulary of fashionable life, the ugly
word "prostitute"! No one placed in so astounding a
situation would stop to reflect that, if he had overheard
such a conversation&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;two centuries
ago, the dominant word would have been, most assuredly,
both shorter and uglier. Not for us at least such cold
philological comfort in the presence of our arch-enemy,
the amateur sociologist. Here we have caught him in the
innermost recess of civilization, caught him at our very
dinner table&mdash;a more loathsome and dangerous foe than
the Satan-Toad squat at the ear of sleeping Eve!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For where in all Creation's round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can now a <i>sleeping</i> Eve be found?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are all awake&mdash;God bless them and save them!&mdash;awake
and listening to the amateur sociologist, or else
to the sociological dramatist, which is every whit as bad,
or worse. They are awake and forming drama-leagues,
attending lectures for political education, giving suffrage
teas and balls, flocking to conventions, marching under
banners and "hiking" in squads, grabbing at slippery
presidents, writing their pretty fingers off, converting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
tenets of the New Morality into lullabies, in short, following
a modern Pied Piper&mdash;into what?</p>

<p>We are brought up with a shock before the blank wall
of our own question, and we are out of our nightmare.
This world, even if in this particular year of grace it does
seem to be overstocked with sociologists, is a pleasanter
place to inhabit than a Hades tenanted by gibbering
ghosts. It is possible to advocate equal franchise and to
help along other causes in which one may believe without
mistaking one's heels for one's head, difficult though this
may be in these dancing days. We suspect that a suffrage
ball in New York is in many ways a less objectionable
affair than a London masquerade of the early eighteenth
century given under the direction of the long forgotten
John James Heidegger. It is fairly certain that in the
same city at the same period "Orator Henley" was as
convinced of his own omniscience as any sociologist or
political economist who discusses the future of the family
or white slavery before a woman's club. Every age must
cherish its pet variation of the standing illusion of the
race&mdash;that for our day and generation we are wiser than
our ancestors were for theirs. Who would not run after a
good thing, and what better things are there to run after
than schemes for human regeneration, even if we frequently
find that our rainbow has not led us to a pot of
gold? Have we not been assured on good authority that
out of the clash of opinions truth emerges? Is it not the
prime article of our democratic creed that the <i>vox populi</i>
is the <i>vox dei</i>, and, even if the <i>vox populi</i> speaks with an
unmistakably sociological twang, is it not our duty, at
the risk of being labelled "undesirable citizens," to imagine,
nay, to believe and aver, that we are listening to the
dulcet harmonies of heaven? What if that gruff old
person, Dr. Samuel Johnson, would, were he alive, assert
in his most stentorian tones that our strenuous democratic
optimism is the vulgarest and the shallowest philosophy
ever permitted by a too indulgent Providence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
flourish under the sun! Is not the grumpy Doctor safely
buried, and common sense along with him?</p>

<p>But this is no way to shake off the effects of a nightmare.
Let us conclude in an humbler, more supplicatory strain.
Will not our gifted reformers, for a while at least, forbear
to announce that they have converted ethics into
a science, and education into a highway to Paradise?
Will not our politicians admit between their speeches,
that people who question or censure their latest panaceas
are, on the whole, exemplary and fairly intelligent citizens,
who in no other respect than their momentary recalcitrancy
seem to be fit candidates for a jail or an asylum?
Will not exponents of New History, New Philosophy,
and New Literature give a slightly larger portion of their
time to reading what a not altogether benighted past managed
to accomplish in those departments of human knowledge,
speculation, and imaginative creation? Will not suffragists
and anti-suffragists call a short truce for the purpose
of admitting that, if a sense of humor and a spirit of
tolerance are totally banished from our devoted country,
the lot of future generations&mdash;if there are to be any&mdash;will
be somewhat parlous? Finally, will not the ladies and
gentlemen who are tearfully or gleefully forecasting the
doom of the monogamous family, occasionally condescend
to glance at Homer's description of the parting of Hector
from Andromache and Astyanax, or at one of Raphael's
Madonnas with the Christ-Child, with the intent of
asking themselves whether in human evolution there are
not other forces at work than those dubbed economic?
Let but these good men and women consider without
impatience their petitioner's modest requests, and he will
wish them Godspeed in their commendable if arduous
and often thankless task of regenerating the human race.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL UNTRUTH AND THE SOCIAL UNREST</h2>


<p>"The Author's object," said Dickens in the original
preface to <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, "in calling public
attention to the system would be very imperfectly fulfilled,
if he did not state now, in his own person, emphatically
and earnestly, that Mr. Squeers and his school are
faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality, purposely
subdued and kept down, lest they should be deemed impossible."
In his preface to the later editions, he speaks
of the race of Yorkshire schoolmasters in the past tense.
"Though it has not yet finally disappeared," he says, "it
is dwindling daily. A long day's work remains to be done
about us in the way of education, Heaven knows; but
great improvements and facilities towards the attainment
of a good one have been furnished, of late years, to those
who can afford to pay for it."</p>

<p>But if, in his pursuit of this object, Dickens had drawn
an exaggerated picture of Dotheboys Hall&mdash;even if he
had depicted as representative of a type that which was,
in point of fact, merely an individual and abnormal instance
of an evil which in general was far less extreme&mdash;the
only objection to such a course would have been the
general objection to any form of untruth; unless, indeed,
we were to add that manifest misrepresentation of this
kind is less likely than a truthful presentation of the case
to be effective for its object. Dickens was driving with
all his might and main at a monstrous blot on English
civilization, a hideous inhumanity and cruelty, to which
hundreds of English children were subjected by heartless
parents or guardians, and by brutal, sordid, and ignorant
schoolmasters. And if in his zeal to wipe out that
blot and to end that monstrous inhumanity he had over-stepped
the bounds of legitimate portrayal, there are few
who would not say that the offense was altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
pardonable. Yet he felt it necessary to assure the world that he
had not done this; and in his preface he not only makes the
general denial of such exaggeration quoted above, but
points explicitly to the observations made by himself, and
the records of courts of law, which form the basis of his
exposure.</p>

<p>When we say that even if Dickens had grossly exaggerated
the character of the Yorkshire schools there would
have been no great harm in it, we have in mind two points
of contrast between the task on which he was engaged and
the spirit of his time, on the one hand, and the general
objective of present-day reform movements and the spirit
of our time, on the other. Upon the desirability of putting
an end to Dotheboys Halls, if they were but one tenth as
evil as they are represented to us in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>,
there can be no difference of opinion among decent human
beings. The question of degree may be of scientific or
historical interest, it can have no practical bearing on the
decision to be reached. An overstatement of the case
may intensify our emotions, it can hardly mislead our
judgment. To know that such a state of things exists is
to desire its extinction; such a thing as the balancing of
gain against loss, of immediate benefit against collateral
or ulterior injury, does not enter into the question at all.
Very different is the case with regard to most of the problems
that are enlisting the interest of those who to-day
are striving for the betterment of social conditions. There
is hardly one of these problems which does not have wide
ramifications connecting it with the whole economic and
social system. In hardly one of them is it possible to say:
Here is a flagrant wrong whose existence no rightminded
person can tolerate, whose immediate removal is a clear
duty, about whose extinction we need not hesitate for a
moment on the score of any evil which may accompany
the good. And this complexity of the problems places
the question of exaggeration, or misrepresentation, or
false perspective, upon an essentially different footing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
As soon as the question of cost&mdash;the question of what
sacrifices, or what dangers, or what ulterior evil effects,
may be involved&mdash;enters into the situation, the question
of degree becomes of vital moment. To represent a given
evil as a vast affliction when in reality it is confined within
narrow bounds, to represent it as hideous, morally or
materially, without just basis, is in these cases much more
than a mere violation of the abstract requirements of
truth. These issues turn fundamentally on the weighing
of the good to be gained against the sacrifices or dangers
which the proposal involves. And the reformer who,
however excellent his purposes, grossly magnifies the evil
deceives and misleads the public just as a merchant does
who weighs with false scales, or a gambler who plays with
loaded dice.</p>

<p>So much for the nature of the specific questions at issue.
But there is a contrast far more important still, which
turns upon the spirit of the time. In our day no serious
attack can be made upon any particular evil in any way
connected with the existing economic order, without
being regarded by great multitudes as part of a general
indictment against that order. At the center of the
socialist movement there is now, as there has been at any
time in the past half-century, a body of convinced believers
in the inherent unfitness of the existing order to
serve man's material and moral needs, and in the feasibility
of a new order which shall replace it to the infinite
improvement and elevation of mankind. But the growth
of socialistic and semi-socialistic sentiment which has
been going on at so extraordinarily rapid a rate during the
past decade, especially in this country, is due in only a
relatively small measure to the making of doctrinal converts.
The growth has been in the main, or at least primarily,
not at the center, but on the fringe, of the socialist
body. It has come about, above all, through that unprecedented
stimulation of humanitarian interest and humanitarian
endeavor in connection with the problems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the poor which is in itself a just cause both for pride and
satisfaction in our generation. Between this humanitarian
activity, directed toward various specific forms of
social betterment, and that kind of discontent with the
existing order which lies at the basis of socialism, there is
at once a sharp contrast and an intimate connection. The
socialist&mdash;at least the socialist as he has traditionally
been&mdash;makes it the first tenet of his practical doctrine
that social-betterment endeavors are not only vain, but
mischievous. He holds that they tend to patch up a
system which is hopelessly evil, and to reconcile to its
continuance those who, if they were not thus deluded,
would see that the only remedy lies in its extinction. In
reality, however, the worker for social-betterment schemes,
while helping to make the existing order sounder with one
hand, is constantly giving powerful aid to the socialists
with the other. For it is part of his task to concentrate
public attention upon evils which would otherwise remain
unnoticed in the background; and it is safe to say that in
the impression made by these agitations upon multitudes
of sensitive natures lies the chief source of that enormous
recruiting of the forces making towards socialism which
we have been witnessing. In so far as this result is the
natural accompaniment of the unfolding of a truthful
picture of society, it must be accepted as an inevitable
fact. Even so, it might be deplored that a development
so momentous should in so large a measure turn on the
state of mind of persons unequipped with such mental
qualities, and such intellectual training, as would fit them
duly to weigh the defects against the virtues of the existing
order, and duly to consider the objections to the proposed
remedy as well as its allurements. But, as the matter
stands, what is actually being furnished to these
susceptible minds and hearts is in large measure a mass of
distorted representations of the truth. The falsity of the
picture is often a matter of direct exaggeration or misstatement,
oftener it is a matter of false perspective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
chiefly taking the form of making a part pass virtually for
the whole. But however it is brought about, we have
continually before us the spectacle of numbers of well-meaning
persons, through careless exaggeration or distortion
of the truth, misleading multitudes of young and
ardent spirits into a readiness to throw overboard the
fundamental institutions of society.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Children of Strife. A Dramatic Story of Rich and
Poor in New York.</i> Such is the title of a novel that is
appearing in the <i>Delineator</i>, an old-established journal of
large circulation, devoted primarily to fashions, housekeeping
matters, and the like. It is very specially "featured."
Its first chapter is ushered in with this notice,
conspicuously printed in large type below the title: "Special
Request: Great things may hinge upon this novel.
Just how great will depend upon your reception of it. It
is thrilling fiction but back of it is something else. Will
you watch for that something, keeping each instalment
by you for reference?" Those who dutifully follow this
last injunction will begin by keeping by them for reference
a picture of the ways of business that is extremely interesting.
Chapter I is entitled "The Corporation." Its
opening scene is in the private office of a flourishing capitalist.
Many little touches are given to heighten the stage
effect, but the real point of interest concerns the giving out
of a contract relating to the construction of a twenty-one
story building. Griffiths, the capitalist, holds an impromptu
meeting of the construction company, the other
directors being office dummies; the question to be decided
is whether steel columns or cast-iron columns are
to be used:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What's the difference in cost?" asked Mr. Griffiths, shortly,
casting a cursory glance over the items.</p>

<p>"If we use the iron we'll save about eighteen thousand dollars,"
the secretary replied, "but the architect says we'll be
taking a risk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"How <i>much</i> of a risk?" Mr. Griffiths retorted quickly.
"Doesn't Littleton think the building will stand up?"</p>

<p>"He <i>thinks</i> so," Williams rejoined deprecatingly. "There
are houses on both sides. He <i>thinks</i> it'll stand up. It ought to."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Griffiths, pushing back his chair. "Nothing
venture, nothing have. Eh, Williams?"</p>

<p>Williams smiled a perfunctory smile in response to his employer's
little jest.</p>

<p>"Let's get to work," went on Mr. Griffiths. "Call the roll.
All present&mdash;full board. (Note that.) We waive reading the
minutes of the last meeting, and there are no reports. Mr. Flynt
offers the following resolution: Resolved, That the secretary
be and hereby is empowered to accept and ratify the contract
heretofore drawn up with Peck &amp; Simpson, for iron columns
(By the way, Williams, White is the chief inspector for that
district. You can handle him, eh?), and to execute the same on
behalf of the Company. All in favor say 'Aye;' contrary
minded, 'No.'" The chair canvassed the vote and reported
that a majority of votes were in favor of the resolution. It was
so voted. "That's all. Meeting adjourned. Good morning."</p></blockquote>

<p>What happens in Chapter III will surprise nobody. Griffiths'
little daughter is with her father in his luxurious
library, absorbed in a story-book, both of them enveloped
in a delicious silence. But the silence is suddenly broken
by a curious and startling sound:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sound had suggested a sliding, the collapse of something;
it was like the falling in of a gigantic house of cards.
Fascinated, Ruth's eyes sought her father's face. It was transformed,
livid; his hands clutched his chair&mdash;clutched it so
convulsively that, plump though they were, the veins stood out
on them in purple knots.</p>

<p>"The building," he whispered with bloodless lips. "It's
gone."</p>

<p>The sliding stopped momentarily; the very air seemed to stay
still in an awful hush of expectation; then it caught up a new
sound&mdash;a sound that far exceeded the sliding in horror; a sound
to freeze the blood, even the warm, quick blood of a child; a
sound big with every emotion ever evoked by the voice of any
tenor who ever has sung&mdash;the inarticulate protest of men
about to be smothered&mdash;the wail of human beings caught in a
trap, like rats.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, it would of course be preposterous to regard a
cheap melodramatic novel in a fashion magazine as a
subject for serious criticism; and it would be equally
absurd to make the policy of such a magazine, taken in
itself, an occasion for solemn moralizing or rebuke. But
in publishing this rubbish, the <i>Delineator</i> is a magazine
of fashion in more senses than one; it is but following,
according to its lights, a fashion current in much higher
circles of "uplift" literature. That this grotesque presentation
of the ways of business appears, and is given all
possible prominence and emphasis, not in a journal devoted
to reform but in one which seeks its circulation
among the women of the average "bourgeois" home, is
precisely what gives significance to a piece of fiction otherwise
too insignificant to mention. Evidently the editor
of this magazine imagines, rightly or wrongly, that the
state of mind prevailing among his readers is such as to
make a thing of this kind go. They have become so
accustomed to a diet of sensationalism and exaggeration,
he may well reason, that they will never stop to inquire
whether the building of collapsible skyscrapers is a common
practice&mdash;whether indeed such a thing has ever happened
at all&mdash;or in any other way to question the truth
of a portrait evidently designed to represent a large part
of the capitalist class. To ask whether either writer or
editor really believes the picture to be true&mdash;to hark
back to Dickens's solemn assurance of the truthfulness
of his indictments against the evils he attacked&mdash;is the
most that need be said on the subject, to anyone accustomed
to sober or responsible thinking. But among the
millions of defenceless people&mdash;young, half-educated,
well-intentioned, untrained to serious thought&mdash;to whom
such stuff is being fed every day, there is a vast number
that are misled by it into a false view of the world, and
into a state of mind that is most unwholesome and deplorable.</p>

<p>What is thus dealt out in popular fiction, what was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
a time to be seen filling the pages of nearly every popular
magazine professedly as plain fact, is met with in a hundred
forms in the daily newspapers&mdash;even those of a
good type&mdash;and in the outgivings of many excellent persons,
and many worthy associations, engaged in social-betterment
work. A very few instances must suffice for
illustration.</p>

<p>"The outstanding infamy of certain of our modern
industries is the linking to the belts of factories and mills
of two million children." This statement, and variants
of it which pile up the agony now in one direction now
in another, we find continually cropping up in the high
places of social reform. The quotation is from an address
made a year ago by William B. Patterson, secretary of
the commission on social service of the Philadelphia Federation
of Churches. He was speaking before the first annual
Progressive Conference of Pennsylvania, and presumably
his object was to show the dire need of the Progressive
movement for the remedy of a stupendous evil.
But we turn to an article on child labor in the United
States by Dr. Jacob S. Raisin, a Troy rabbi, printed very
prominently in the <i>Knickerbocker Press</i>, for a more vivid
realization of this gigantic horror. Here are some extracts
from the article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two million children are virtually enslaved in our cotton
mills, coal mines and sweat-shops over the breadth and length
of our country&mdash;two million little ones!</p>

<p>At the same time that thousands of children in our city enjoyed
their Christmas vacation and rejoiced over their newly
acquired presents, two million children of the same tender age,
of the same Caucasian race and citizens of the same prosperous
land, were pining away in the dark subterranean caves of the
coal mines in the east, in the dangerous cotton mills and tobacco
factories of the south and the sweat-shops everywhere.</p>

<p>Two million souls are annually sacrificed to commerce and to
greed. Parents do not get sufficient to keep the souls and
bodies of their little ones together. Mothers must leave their
suckling babes to seek for their livelihood, and these infants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
in turn, if they survive until they are six, must begin the battle
of life on their own account.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States Census of 1910 gives the total number
of mine-workers under sixteen years of age in 1909
as 8,151, of whom 3,117 were working below ground and
5,034 above ground. The number of wage-earners under
sixteen years of age in manufacturing industries is stated
as 161,493; and it is shown that the percentage of workers
under sixteen to the whole number of workers in these
industries fell from 3.4 per cent. in 1899 to 2.9 per cent.
in 1904 and 2.4 per cent. in 1909. Figures concerning
sweat-shops are not given.</p>

<p>What we have before us, therefore, is a gross overstatement,
on the face of it; after making all possible allowance
for false returns of age in the census, it is evident that,
merely as a matter of the surface figures, the case is enormously
exaggerated. But this is not all. The impression
is always sought to be conveyed that these two millions
are, in large part at least <i>little</i> children; whereas even of
the (say) two hundred thousand workers under sixteen
who are actually "linked to the belts of factories and
mills," and of the (say) four thousand who are laboring
"in the dark subterranean caves of the coal mines," it is
obvious that only a small fraction can be under fourteen.
That there ought not to be a single one may be true
enough; but unless we are to throw reason overboard altogether,
we must make a distinction between a question
concerning a few hundreds, or a few thousands, of little
children, and one concerning two million. And these
very agitators <i>do</i> recognize the distinction; else why make
all this noise about the figures? Driven into a corner,
they would doubtless fall back on the iniquity of having
even a single child in all the land deprived of its birthright
of happiness; but in the meanwhile they work the
two million for all it is worth. As for the violation of the
Ninth Commandment, the true Progressive, whether
Christian or Jew, presumably finds in the principles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
New Morality ample exemption from any acute pangs of
conscience on that score.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early part of the year 1910, the Consumers'
League of New York obtained permission from the <i>American
Magazine</i> to reprint as a leaflet a little article of two
pages which had appeared in the January number of that
periodical under the title <i>Some Dangers from High Prices</i>.
The article which the excellent persons who conduct
the work of that League considered so important a
document was devoted in the first place to a very precise
account of what had happened in a certain restaurant
with which the writer was familiar, and which was frequented
in part by shop-girls; and secondly to the issuing
of a most solemn and tragic warning as to what this country
was threatened with as a consequence of the situation
which this happening indicated. This is the experience:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Five and six years ago I used to go to a restaurant which fed
about three hundred shop-girls a day.... I used to write down
what they could get for 15 cents. Here are three dishes each
of which then cost 15 cents. Two eggs on toast, with bread; a
nice little meat pie, hot and appetizing; chicken on toast with a
rice border. The chicken was all dark meat, to be sure, but it
was meat and the rice border was generous. In short, in that
restaurant six years ago there was for 15 cents honest nourishment
fitted to build up an honest constitution such as the trunk
class of America ought to have. And in the long run those
girls chose the nourishing food. Two years ago a change came.
I noticed a habit of lunching off a potato salad. I soon saw the
reason. The little meat pie had moved up to 25 cents, the
chicken on toast to 30 cents. Potato salad, one of the girls told
me, was the only "interesting" thing left for 15 cents. Going
there last September I said to one of the waitresses:</p>

<p>"What are these girls eating now?"</p>

<p>"Ah," she sighed, "it is dreadful! They ought not to pay
more than 15 cents; so many of them just have griddle cakes,
or sweets and coffee. They can have two cream cakes and
coffee or an eclair and coffee for 15 cents."</p>

<p>Please notice the sliding scale of nourishment therein displayed
in six short years. From chicken on toast with a wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
rice border to potato salad and from potato salad to an
eclair and coffee. One can fairly see the nourishment ooze out!
It is only fair to add, however, that the manager told me that
they were losing their shop-girls somewhat: they were going
where there were no waitresses, where they served themselves
at counters. There one could get real nourishment for 20 cents.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the basis of this interesting little story, and of the
loose talk of "a dealer in milk" with whom she had conversed,
the writer finds that there is a "canker at the heart
of our prosperity," that "our great, prosperous country
is at the parting of the ways." "A little more," she warns
us, "and you will have the trunk class of America an underfed
class, being slowly but surely forced down in the social
scale." And so forth.</p>

<p>Now it is nothing that such an article should have appeared
in a popular magazine; nor is it perhaps a matter
worth finding fault with that the managers of an important
humanitarian organization, which is in many
ways doing excellent work, should have had so little critical
judgment as to regard as an exceptionally important
contribution to public discussion what is so manifestly
the mere expression of one person's superficial observations
and impressions. What <i>does</i> give significance to the
Consumers' League's performance is that it demonstrates
an indifference to facts&mdash;a lack of the sense of responsibility
for the essential veracity of anything to which one
gives one's name and which one actively disseminates
among the public&mdash;that would be amazing were it not
unfortunately so common. In half an hour, any officer of
the Consumers' League could have discovered that in
New York "honest nourishment" of precisely the kind
referred to in the <i>American</i> article was to be obtained for
fifteen cents in any one of hundreds of clean, roomy,
cheerful restaurants&mdash;not "where they served themselves
at counters," but with good waiting by a fine type of
waitresses. At the time the leaflet was issued, there had
been no rise of prices at all in this class of restaurants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
New York; since then there has been a rise in some of
them, affecting certain dishes; but in no case, I believe,
has the rise been more than that from fifteen to twenty
cents. The <i>great</i> rise in food prices has taken place in the
four years <i>since</i> January, 1910; and yet to this day one
can get, in any one of the scores of handsome popular
restaurants scattered all over the business section of New
York, a nourishing meat or egg luncheon, well served, for
fifteen or twenty cents, according to choice.</p>

<p>This may seem very homely matter, beneath the dignity
of a quarterly <span class="smcap">Review</span>. But the homeliness, or insignificance,
is only on the surface. The thing I am concerned
with is not the bread and meat I am talking about,
but the state of mind of a class of men and women considerable
in point of mere numbers and tremendously
important in their influence on the political and social
currents of the time. With a responsibility resting on
them a thousandfold greater than any that belonged to
reformers like Dickens&mdash;a thousandfold greater both
because the problems they touch are incomparably more
complex and because the consequences of their agitation
spread out immeasurably beyond the particular problems
they touch&mdash;with this responsibility for truthful representation
upon them, how far are they from that realization
of it which is so solemnly avowed by the author of
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>! And in this matter of the luncheon,
small as it may seem in itself, the moral obtrudes itself
with peculiar distinctness. For here everything turns
absolutely on degree. If the shop-girl can get to-day for
twenty cents the luncheon she could formerly get for
fifteen, the whole terror disappears; for five cents a day
is thirty cents a week, and surely it is not out of the question
that there has been a rise of wages sufficient to cover
this difference. Yet these good people evidently think it
no harm to give out a solemn warning of national degeneration
and ruin, based on figures which a few minutes'
inquiry would have compelled them to reject, and on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
allegation of fact as to the actual fare of working girls
which a half-day's tour of the restaurants of New York
would have shown to have no substantial basis. That
the rise of prices has been hard on working people, that
if it takes place without compensating rise of wages it
must have serious consequences, is true enough; but between
this and the sort of thing we have been discussing
there is precisely the difference that there is between
reason and unreason, between responsibility and recklessness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To <i>prove</i> that exaggeration and distortion and misleading
presentation abound in the reform literature of our time
is not the purpose of this paper; even if fifty examples
were adduced, it would prove nothing. What I am endeavoring
to do is to cite a very few illustrations, which
I believe that intelligent readers will recognize as typical,
and to bring out their significance as bearing on a widespread
state of mind. In this regard, the next instance
is peculiarly instructive. In the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for
March, 1910, there is an article by E. A. Ross, entitled
<i>The Suppression of Important News</i>. The <i>Atlantic</i> is
not a "muckraking" magazine, and the writer is not
a "muckraker;" he is a man of national note, and a professor
in the Department of Economics in the University
of Wisconsin. Much that he says about the shortcomings
of newspapers is true; but the article gives a preposterously
false impression of the conduct of the press of this
country as a whole. However, I do not ask the readers
of this <span class="smcap">Review</span> to take my word for this; neither can I enter
upon what would be the very considerable task of proving
my assertion. I wish only to call attention to a single
short paragraph in Prof. Ross's article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The party system is a "sacred cow." When a county district
court declared that the Initiative and Referendum amendment
to the Oregon Constitution was invalid, the item was spread
broadcast. But when later the Supreme Court of Oregon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
reversed that decision, the fact was too trivial to be put on the
wires.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, if this means anything, it means that it is the policy
of the Associated Press, in regard to such a matter as the
Initiative and Referendum system in Oregon, to endeavor
to conceal from the American public the fact that the
attempt to overthrow it in the courts of the State had
failed. To characterize such a notion as silly would be
to place it on far too high a plane. That a person of
Prof. Ross's training, and position in the country, should
find it possible to believe such a thing is melancholy to
think of; and, what is more to the purpose, it betrays a
state of mind that is fraught with all manner of evil possibilities.
For it is a state of mind in which probability,
that indispensable guide of sane thinking, is dismissed
from its place; in which whatever seems to point toward
a preconceived thesis is accepted without scrutiny and
carefully treasured up, and whatever points the other way
gets scant attention; in which the sense of the true proportions
of things is hopelessly lost. What the actual
facts were about the transmission of that news from Oregon
makes no difference; the failure "to put it on the
wires," which Professor Ross alleges, may possibly have
taken place. But no intelligent human being waits to
find out whether Beiliss actually did or did not murder
a child in order to reject with scorn and contempt the idea
that the blood of murdered Christian children forms part
in the ritual of the Jewish Passover; we need no evidence
on the subject&mdash;it is disposed of by its intrinsic absurdity.
That Prof. Ross should have failed to see the intrinsic
absurdity of such a notion of the newspaper press of the
United States as is implied in the paragraph above quoted&mdash;that
others who talk about the suppression of news
should betray similar want of sane perception&mdash;is, to my
mind, one of the most significant illustrations of the
general phenomenon that I am discussing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>If these illustrations have served to bring out some of
the chief aspects of the state of mind which underlies the
exaggeration that disfigures the reform agitations of our
time, the purpose for which they have been cited has been
fulfilled. As evidence of the fact that such exaggeration
is widely current they of course amount to nothing; nor,
as I have already said, would the piling up of a large number
of examples have any probative force. There is a
great deal of sober and responsible writing in reform
quarters, and there is a great deal of the opposite kind.
It would be idle to attempt to form any estimate of the
ratio between the one kind and the other. But every
reader must recognize that the type of thing which I have
been discussing is abundant, and that it plays an important
part in influencing the opinions of large bodies of well-meaning
people. It may not be amiss, however, to make
brief mention of a few more examples illustrating various
phases of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the report of the first of a series of lectures on sex
hygiene recently given to fathers and mothers in the
public school buildings of Chicago, we find the lecturer
saying: "The American mothers are unable to nurse their
children for the necessary nine months. This is the cause
of all the infant mortality we hear so much about." And
it is to the economic conditions of "the last fifty years"
that this deplorable state of things is ascribed. Now
persons who are conversant with mortality statistics,
either at first hand or through the columns of the newspapers,
know that while it is true that "we hear so much
about" infant mortality, what we hear is not that it is
increasing but that it is declining&mdash;declining in the City
of New York especially, at a rate so steady and so rapid
as would have been pronounced incredible a quarter of a
century ago. But the mothers who were drinking in the
lecturer's words were led to believe that our modern society
is responsible for an ever-increasing slaughter of the
innocents. Nor is this an isolated case, either in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the particular subject concerned, or to questions of social
welfare generally. The mere fact that the evil of avoidable
infant mortality is dwelt upon in our time as never
before was taken by this lecturer&mdash;and has been taken
by others&mdash;as meaning that that evil is growing ever
worse; whereas the real reason of its prominence is precisely
that it is now for the first time being hopefully and
successfully attacked by comprehensive and systematic
efforts. And this substitution of the assertion that an
evil is growing worse for the mere fact that it exists, so far
from being uncommon, is met with in connection with
almost every branch of social-betterment agitation.</p>

<p>One of the most striking manifestations of this was
furnished by Alfred Russel Wallace in his book, <i>Social
Environment and Moral Progress</i>, which appeared shortly
before his death. "It is not too much to say," he declares,
"that our whole system of society is rotten from
top to bottom, and the social environment as a whole,
in relation to our possibilities and claims, is the worst
that the world has ever seen." In support of this assertion
the book as a whole does nothing but present in eloquent
language various deplorable features of our existing civilization;
apparently the idea that in order to justify his conclusion
comparison with former states of the world is essential
hardly crosses Mr. Wallace's mind. That it did
obtrude itself in a measure appears, however, from the
devotion of one little chapter to the subject of "Indications
of Increasing Moral Degradation." These indications
are three in number; and not only are they pitifully
inadequate for the support of his statement, but his interpretation
of the statistics cited, in regard to the matter
to which he gives most prominence, can be easily shown
to be utterly superficial and inconclusive. The three
matters to which the statistics relate are deaths from
alcoholism, suicide, and deaths of infants soon after birth.
The increase of deaths from alcoholism in the past half-century
is given the leading place. This increase has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
been, roughly, 25 per million inhabitants&mdash;from 40 per
million annually to 65 per million annually; and it does
not occur to Mr. Wallace that modern advances in medicine
and sanitation may account for far more than 25
drunkards per million inhabitants who in former times
would have been carried off by all sorts of diseases but
who now survive long enough to die of "alcoholism."
The temper of the man of science wholly fails to assert
itself in the weighing of facts which his zeal as a reformer
impels him to view in the light of a preconceived judgment.</p>

<p>Some recent phenomena in the field of public discussion
in our country have shown on a large scale the kind of
loose thinking in regard to facts which is at the bottom
of the exaggerating spirit. When the McNamara dynamitings
were revealed, a wave of excitement swept off
their feet a large part of our whole humanitarian army.
They had been so filled with the idea that we are living
in a strange and awful time, that this series of crimes,
committed in secret by members of a single trade union,
was acclaimed as something new under the sun, a fearful
sign and portent. The tremendous railroad riots and
burnings of 1877; the anarchist troubles at Chicago, culminating
in the Haymarket massacre; the widespread and
ominous railroad labor struggle of 1894, which took on an
aspect bordering upon civil war&mdash;all these things were
forgotten, and it was solemnly asserted that we were confronted
with a crisis quite without precedent or parallel,
which demanded a new and radical examination of the
very foundations of the social order. The swift spread
over the country a year ago of the notion that starvation
wages for women were, if not the sole, at least incomparably
the chief, cause of female vice and degradation,
was a somewhat similar phenomenon. One that at first
sight presents no resemblance to it, but which strikes me
as a peculiarly interesting manifestation of the same thing,
is to be found in the domain of ordinary politics. A leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
feature of the Progressive crusade was the identification
of the "reactionaries"&mdash;the business world and the
conservative newspaper press&mdash;with bossism and the
corruption of politics generally. Mr. Roosevelt continually
talked as though there were a cynical alliance between
all the leading New York newspapers on the one
hand, and Murphy and Barnes and the whole system of
political corruption on the other; and doubtless there were
millions of good people who completely forgot not only
that a large proportion of these papers had persistently
fought for civil service reform and tariff reform and election
reform, but that they were waging an uncompromising
war against the whole brood of bosses, whether Republican
or Democratic, for many years during which
Mr. Roosevelt was an excellent friend of Quay, got along
very fairly with Platt, and did not find it in his heart even
to lift a finger against the unspeakable Addicks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now all these various forms of exaggeration, distortion
and misrepresentation converge in our time upon one
object, contribute toward one common effect. Whatever
be the purpose held in view by any particular reformer or
exhorter, however far from his desire it may be to foment
dangerous unrest or to promote a revolutionary propaganda,
every extravagant picture that he draws of the
depravity or the wretchedness of our time inevitably does
produce these effects, and that upon a large scale. There
are a great number of people of all ages, and especially of
young people, who, without having thought deeply upon
the problems of society, feel about them very deeply indeed.
Many of them attest the sincerity of their interest
by useful and noble work; the world has certainly never
seen anything like so widespread a devotion of the energies
of young men and women among the fortunate classes
to the betterment of the lot of the unfortunate. A far
greater number, without devoting themselves to such
work, are stirred by the same emotions of sympathy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
good-will. Upon these minds and hearts the depiction of
evils associated with the existing economic order produces
more than a mere transient pang of distress or regret.
What is wrong in the world they do not merely deplore;
they wish to set it right. And if the wrong is so pervasive,
the evil so deep-seated, the depravity so general, as these
manifold presentments make it out, what more natural
than that they should sum up the whole case in the conviction
that the existing order of society is a failure, and
be ready to welcome almost any experiment that holds
out the promise of something better?</p>

<p>It is for this reason, above all others, that he who recklessly
or thoughtlessly distorts or exaggerates the facts of
our time assumes a grievous responsibility. Even in
regard to each particular question, the element of degree
may be of vital consequence: what measures ought to
be taken, what objections ought to be weighed, what
collateral consequences ought to be ignored, in regard to
such a matter as the minimum wage, or unemployment
insurance, or child labor, may depend essentially both
upon the present extent of the evil and upon the influences
already acting upon it. But it is the larger question
that is most deeply involved, the question whether the
institutions and traditions which have been slowly built
up by ages of human effort and trial and struggle are to
be thrown aside as worthless. To the reformer bent upon
his own specific purpose it may seem a venial offense to
depict poverty as increasing, when it is really diminishing,
so long as there <i>is</i> poverty; to represent the press of the
country in general as deliberately suppressing ordinary
news of public affairs, so long as there are some newspapers
which suppress some kinds of news; to talk of two
millions of children linked to the belts of factories and
mills or pining underground in mines, so long as there is
child labor; to speak of avoidable infant mortality as an
evil peculiar to our time though the reverse is the truth,
so long as there is infant mortality which is avoidable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
But between seeing these things as they are and seeing
them as they are not, the difference is not trifling, but
fundamental. For upon that difference turns the whole
issue between conservative improvement and reckless
innovation. The world is full of persons who are eager
enough to prove all things, but who seem to forget the
other half of the injunction. If we apply the probe carelessly,
if we report what we find untruthfully, how can we
hope to hold fast that which is good?</p>

<h2>NATURAL ARISTOCRACY</h2>


<p>One evening not long since, in a certain New York
club of authors and scholars, the conversation
turned, as it is so accustomed to turn, on the politics of
the day; and we were astonished when one of the circle,
a distinguished student of sociology well-known for his
radical opinions, said with conviction and emphasis that
we were talking of little things and that the one great
question of the day was whether a democratic society
could develop a natural aristocracy. By chance I had
with me that night an excellent new book on <i>The Political
Philosophy of Burke</i>, by Prof. John MacCunn, late of the
University of Liverpool, and as we left the club I showed
it to one of my fellow writers with a word of commendation.
"Ah," he said, handing it back unopened, "Burke!
he's dead, isn't he?" Well, Burke, I dare say, is dead for
us, as so many other great memories have perished, and
Lord Morley (plain John Morley then, a fairly practical
statesman) was indulging in the usual illusion of the
biographer when, just twenty-five years ago, he closed
his luminous volume with the prophecy that "the historic
method, fitting in with certain dominant conceptions in
the region of natural science, is bringing men round to a
way of looking at society for which Burke's maxims are
exactly suited; and it seems probable that he will be more
frequently and more seriously referred to within the next
twenty years than he has been within the whole of the
last eighty." The historic method has an odd way of
discrediting the authority of history, and certainly in the
lustrum since Lord Morley's predicted score of years
the world of Lloyd George and Mr. Roosevelt has not
been referring abundantly to Burke's maxims. Yet, with
the words of my radical sociological friend in my ears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
I could not help reflecting on the coincidence that Professor
MacCunn, a writer thoroughly imbued with modern
ideas, should have led the whole of Burke's political
philosophy up to the same question of natural aristocracy.
"For Burke's feet," he says, "were never on surer ground
than when, as we have seen, he argued that a civil society,
by the very conditions of social struggle and growth,
must needs evolve 'a natural aristocracy, without which
there is no nation.'" And then, being sufficiently trained
in the historic method, he proceeds to show how Burke
entirely missed the real problem that faces society to-day
in its effort to create such a leadership&mdash;as if human
nature had first sprung into existence with the Reform
Bill.</p>

<p>Of the urgency of the problem a reflective man will
scarcely doubt. The only thing, in fact, that might lead
him to question its urgency is its hoary antiquity. Plato
wrestled with it when he undertook to outline the ideal
republic, and many of his pages on the range of government
through its five forms&mdash;aristocracy, timocracy,
oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny&mdash;sound as if he had
been reading yesterday's newspapers of London and New
York. In the orgy of misrule that brought Athens to
humiliation in the last years of the Peloponnesian war he
had seen oligarchs and democrats tearing at each other's
throats like mad dogs; he had seen the disastrous triumph
of the democratic party, and, knowing its instability,
he had composed the long dialogue of <i>The Republic</i> to
show how, if possible, it might be saved from impending
tyranny. He wrote, so far as the public was concerned,
in a spirit of despair, almost as if foreseeing the domination
of an Alexander and the cold despotism of Rome;
and in that saddened scepticism he was thinking more of
holding up the aristocratic principle of balance and restraint
before the happier individual soul, and establishing
the idea of justice for any pious seeker of the future,
than of creating an actual commonwealth. Yet, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
his application of the law of the individual to the machinery
of politics may appear at times fantastic, his argument
never really gets far from the everlasting questions
of government.</p>

<p>The oligarchy which he knew and described was what
we should rather call a plutocracy. He had in mind a
State in which, "instead of loving contention and honor
[as under a timocracy], men become lovers of money and
business, and they praise and admire the rich man and
confer office upon him, but despise the poor man." "And
such a State," he adds, "will necessarily be not one but
two States, one of the poor, the other of the rich, who are
living in the same place and always plotting against each
other." And when in such a society the disposers of wealth
proceed from privilege to insolence and folly, and on their
side the many have lost the sense of reverence and at the
same time have become aware of the sheer power of numbers,
then the plutocratic State is converted to the true
democracy, the unbridled sway of the majority. The
change is like that which comes to a rich young man who,
forgetting the discipline of necessity, passes into the libertinism
of indulgence. He will hearken to no word of
advice; and if anyone tells him there is a distinction
among pleasures, that some are the satisfaction of gross
and ignoble desires and others are the satisfaction of
good and useful desires, he shakes his head in superiority,
and swears that all pleasures are alike. So the oligarchical
faction loses its power and position; and the democracy
in its turn follows the same path, despising the constraint
of authority and the guidance of experience, caught by
the lure of indiscriminate pleasure. "The father comes
down to the level of the son, being afraid of his children,
and the son is on a level with his father, having no shame
or fear of his parents.... So the schoolmaster fears and
flatters his scholars, and the scholars despise their masters
and tutors; and, in general, young and old are alike, the
young competing with the old in speech and action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the old men condescending to the young in their gay and
easy manners, from dread of being thought morose and
dictatorial."</p>

<p>Then arises the problem which confronted the State in
Plato's day, as it did in Burke's, and which may not seem
entirely irrelevant to the watcher of to-day: How shall
the people be saved from themselves? How, indeed? To
Plato, who beheld the future as in a vision, the actual
historic answer was a gloomy picture of the change from
license to tyranny. His account of the impending fall
can never lose its fresh interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil
cup-bearers presiding over the feast, then, unless her rulers are
very amenable and give a plentiful draft, she calls them to account
and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
And loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves
who hug their chains; she would have subjects who are like
rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are the men whom
she praises and honors both in private and public.</p>

<p>By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and
ends by getting among the animals and infecting them. Nor
must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes
in relation to each other. And I must add that no one who
does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty
which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in
a democracy than in any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as
the proverb says, are as good as their she-mistresses, and the
horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the
rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at anybody
who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for
them: and all things are just ready to burst with liberty.</p>

<p>The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same
desire magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy&mdash;the
truth being that the excessive increase of anything
often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is
the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal
life, but above all in forms of government. The excess of liberty,
whether in States or individuals, seems only to pass into
excess of slavery. And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy,
and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery
out of the most extreme form of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one
another. The people have always some champion whom they
set over them and nurse into greatness. This is he who begins
to make a party against the rich. After a while he is driven out,
but comes back, in spite of his enemies, a tyrant full grown.
Then comes the famous request for a body-guard&mdash;"Let not
the people's friend," as they say, "be lost to them." (Jowett,
condensed.)</p></blockquote>

<p>One escape from this fatal declension Plato saw&mdash;that,
by the working of the inner law of self-restraint or
by some divine interposition, the people should, before
it was too late, be turned to hearken to their natural
leaders, and the State should thus develop from anarchy
into a true aristocracy. The question, then or at any time,
is not whether there shall be leaders, but of what character
these leaders shall be. There was the brawling tribe of
demagogues and sycophants in the Athenian democracy,
as there have been at other times of licentious upheaval.
And the character of these men is always the same: they
lead by flattery and by clamorous justification of the
passing wave of desire. The aristocratic leaders whom
Plato had in mind, and whom, for the confusion of posterity,
he called philosophers, were of the very opposite
sort, being men who should guide by imposing their
authority and experience on the impulsive emotions of
the multitude. They should be politicians who might
dare the displeasure of the people, as Burke dared his
constituents at Bristol: "The very attempt towards pleasing
everybody discovers a temper always flashy, and
often false and insincere.... I am to look, indeed, to
your opinions; but to such opinions as you and I <i>must</i>
have five years hence." They should be philosophers
like John Stuart Mill, who, facing the electors of Westminster
and being asked whether he had ever said the
English workingmen were "generally liars," replied simply,
"I did." Such were to be the aristocrats of Plato's
State, men of simple and rational desires, lords of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
own souls, and so masters of others. Nor should they
govern for their own smaller profit. For, as Socrates
says, "it is not to the injury of the servant that we think
he ought to be governed, but because it behooves each of
us to be governed by the divine wisdom, having that
power within us if possible, or, if that be impossible, then
by an external authority, so that we may all, following
the same guidance, be brought into likeness one to another
and into good will."</p>

<p>There is something at once strange and familiar in this
political discussion, now more than two thousand years
old. To it Plato brought all his wisdom, sometimes not
disdaining sophistry, trying to show by what kind of
education and by what arts of persuasion and illusion a
natural aristocracy could be imposed and maintained. It
was pretty much the same problem that confronted Burke
at the time of the French Revolution, inspiring his earlier
writings on that event with incomparable eloquence, and
stinging him in the end almost to a frenzy of despair.
Burke did not come to the question with so clear an intuition
as the Greek, and in some ways his <i>Reflections</i>, despite
their modern dress, are more remote from us than is
Plato's <i>Republic</i>, because he dealt less with the universal
aspects of human nature. And in so far as his practical
reason was colored by the peculiar circumstances of his
own day, it has lost in direct application to the needs of
another age. But he is not dead, despite my literary
friend; wisdom is of longer life than the generations of
mankind, and there is scarcely another book of modern
times so full of political wisdom as Burke's <i>Reflections</i>.</p>

<p>And we must note, in the first place, that to Burke, as to
Plato, it never occurred to think that society, even under
the most lawless anarchy, could exist without leaders.
"Power," he knew, "of some kind or other, will survive
the shock in which manners and opinions perish." He
knew too, and declared, that in the end he who made
himself master of the army would overbear all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
influences; but meanwhile he beheld the State of France
under the sway of demagogues who were preparing the
people for a carnival of blood and cruelty, and all his eloquence
was exerted, and with extraordinary effect, to
avert from his own country this plague of revolution.
The <i>philosophes</i>, who had prepared the dogmas of popular
flattery for the mouths of a Marat and a Robespierre,
had intensified in Burke the natural British distrust of
all application of abstract reasoning to government and
the affairs of life; and he felt a profound aversion for
those who would "lay down metaphysic propositions
which infer universal consequences," and would then
"limit logic by despotism." Being thus barred from
belief in a true philosophy, by his experience of the false,
yet having himself a mind that grasped at general principles,
he turned to "the happy effect of following nature,
which is wisdom without reflection, and above it." In
that "discipline of nature" he looked for the genuine
guidance of society, and one of the memorable passages of
his works is that in which he describes the character of
those who, themselves under this control, should be for
others "men of light and leading":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the
State, or separable from it. It is an essential integrant part of
any large body rightly constituted. It is formed out of a class
of legitimate presumptions, which, taken as generalities, must be
admitted for actual truths. To be bred in a place of estimation;
to see nothing low and sordid from one's infancy; to be taught
to respect one's self; to be habituated to the censorial inspection
of the public eye; to look early to public opinion; to stand upon
such elevated ground as to be enabled to take a large view of the
widespread and infinitely diversified combinations of men and
affairs in a large society; to have leisure to read, to reflect, to
converse; to be enabled to draw the court and attention of the
wise and learned wherever they are to be found;&mdash;to be habituated
in armies to command and to obey; to be taught to despise
danger in the pursuit of honor and duty; to be formed to
the greatest degree of vigilance, foresight, and circumspection,
in a state of things in which no fault is committed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
impunity, and the slightest mistakes draw on the most ruinous
consequences;&mdash;to be led to a guarded and regulated conduct,
from a sense that you are considered as an instructor of your
fellow-citizens in their highest concerns, and that you act as a
reconciler between God and man;&mdash;to be employed as an administrator
of law and justice, and to be thereby amongst the
first benefactors to mankind;&mdash;to be a professor of high science,
or of liberal and ingenuous art;&mdash;to be amongst rich traders, who
from their success are presumed to have sharp and vigorous
understandings, and to possess the virtues of diligence, order,
constancy, and regularity, and to have cultivated an habitual
regard to commutative justice&mdash;these are the circumstances of
men, that form what I should call a <i>natural</i> aristocracy, without
which there is no nation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not many, even among the wisest of our own generation,
would fail to respond favorably to that glowing picture
of nature's aristocrats, but when we come to the means
by which Burke would assure the existence and supremacy
of such a class, it is different. Despite some tincture of
the so-called "enlightenment," which few men of that
age could entirely escape, Burke had a deep distrust of the
restive, self-seeking nature of mankind, and as a restraint
upon it he would magnify the passive as opposed to the
active power of what is really the same human nature.
This passive instinct he called "prejudice"&mdash;the unreasoning
and unquestioning attachment to the family and
"the little platoon we belong to in society," from which
our affection, coincident always with a feeling of contented
obligation, is gradually enlarged to take in the peculiar
institutions of our country; "prejudice renders a man's
virtues his habits, ... through just prejudice his duty
becomes a part of his nature." Prejudice is thus the
binding force which works from below upwards; the corresponding
force which moves from above is "prescription"&mdash;the
possession of rights and authority which
have been confirmed by custom. In other words, Burke
believed that the only practical way of ensuring a natural
aristocracy was by the acceptance of a prescriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
oligarchy; in the long run and after account had been taken
of all exceptions&mdash;and he was in no wise a blind worshipper
of the Whig families which then governed England&mdash;he
believed that the men of light and leading
would already be found among, or by reason of their
preëminence would be assumed into, the class of those
whose views were broadened by the inherited possession of
privilege and honors.</p>

<p>He so believed because it seemed to him that prejudice
and prescription were in harmony with the methods of
universal nature. Sudden change was abhorrent to him,
and in every chapter of history he read that the only
sound social development was that which corresponded
to the slow and regular growth of a plant, deep-rooted in
the soil and drawing its nourishment from ancient concealed
sources. <i>Saltus non facit natura.</i> In such a plan
prejudice was the ally of the powers of time, opposing to
all visionary hopes a sense of duty to the solid existing
reality, and compelling upstart theory to prove itself by
winning through long resistance. And with the force of
time stood the kindred force of order and subordination
personified in privilege. "A disposition to preserve, and
an ability to improve, taken together," would be Burke's
standard of a statesman; "everything else is vulgar in
the conception, perilous in the execution." In passages
of a singular elevation he combines the ideas of Hobbes
on the social contract with those of Hooker on the sweep
of divine universal law, harmonizing them with the newer
conception of evolutionary growth. "Each contract of
each particular State," he says, "is but a clause in the
great primeval contract of eternal society, linking the
lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible and
invisible world, according to a fixed compact sanctioned
by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all
moral natures, each in their appointed place." And thus,
too, "our political system is placed in a just correspondence
and symmetry with the order of the world, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed
of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of
a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious
incorporation of the human race, the whole, at
one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but, in a
condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through
the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and
progression. Thus, by preserving the method of nature,
in the conduct of the State, in what we improve, we are
never wholly new; in what we retain, we are never wholly
obsolete."</p>

<p>If we look below these ideas of prejudice and privilege,
time and subordination, for their one animating principle,
we shall find it, I think, in the dominance of the faculty
of the imagination. Nor did this imaginative substructure
lying beneath all of Burke's writings and speeches,
from the early essay on the <i>Sublime and Beautiful</i> to his
latest outpourings on the French Revolution, escape the
animadversion of his enemies. Tom Paine made good use
of this trait in <i>The Rights of Man</i>, which he issued as an
answer to the <i>Reflections</i>. "The age of chivalry is gone,"
Burke had exclaimed at the close of his famous tirade on
the fall of Marie Antoinette. "Now all is changed. All
the pleasing illusions, which made power gentle, and obedience
liberal, which harmonized the different shades of
life, and which, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into
politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private
society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire
of light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to
be rudely torn off. All the superadded ideas, furnished
from the wardrobe of a <i>moral imagination</i>...." To this
Paine retorted with terrible incision. Ridiculing the
lamentation over the French Queen as a mere sentimental
rhapsody, he catches up Burke's very words with malign
cunning: "Not one glance of compassion, not one commiserating
reflection, that I can find throughout his book,
has he bestowed on those who lingered out the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
wretched of lives, a life without hope in the most miserable
of prisons. It is painful to behold a man employing his
talents to corrupt himself. Nature has been kinder to
Mr. Burke than he has been to her. He is not affected
by the reality of distress touching his heart, but by the
showy resemblance of it striking his imagination. He
pities the plumage, but forgets the dying bird."</p>

<p>Now there is an element of truth in Paine's charge, but
there is distortion also. To say that Burke had no thought
for the oppressed and the miserable is a wanton slander,
disproved by abundant passages in the very <i>Reflections</i>
and by his whole career. "If it should come to the last
extremity," he had once avowed in Parliament, with no
fear of contradiction, "and to a contest of blood, God forbid!
God forbid!&mdash;my part is taken; I would take my
fate with the poor, and low, and feeble." But it is the
fact nevertheless, construe it how one will, that in the
ordinary course of things Burke's ideas of government
were moulded and his sentiment towards life was colored
by the vivid industry of his imagination, and that he
thought the world at large controlled by the same power.
I doubt if analysis can reach a deeper distinction between
the whole class of minds to which Burke belongs, and that
to which Paine belongs, than is afforded by this difference
in the range and texture of the imagination.</p>

<p>And in this Burke had with him the instinct of his
people, while in a way transcending it; for a good deal of
what we regard as the British character depends on just
the excess of imagination over a rather dull sensibility
and sluggish intelligence. This, if we look into it, is what
Bagehot signalized as the saving dulness of England, and
what Walpole meant by attributing to "the good sense
[note the contrast of <i>sense</i> and <i>sensibility</i>] of the English
that they have not painted better." It was this same
quality that inspired Burke's great comparison of the
French excitability with the British stolidity: "Because
half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of
great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British
oak, chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine
that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants
of the field." In its higher working, when sensibility and
intelligence are also magnified, the imagination, no doubt,
is the source of the loftier English poetry and eloquence,
but in the lower range, which we are now considering,
it is rather a slow, yet powerful and endearing, visualization
of what is known and familiar; it is the beginning
of distrust for innovation and of that prejudice for existing
circumstances and actual relations which Burke exalted
as the mother of content. And with content it produces
a kind of egotistic satisfaction in the pomps and privileges
which pass before the eye, giving to the humble a participation
in things wherein they have no material share.
In the baser nature this evokes a trait which we condemn
as snobbishness; in the higher it results in a fine magnanimity:
"He feels no ennobling principle in his own
heart, who wishes to level all the artificial institutions
which have been adopted for giving a body to opinion and
permanence to fugitive esteem. It is a sour, malignant,
envious disposition, without taste for the reality, or for
any image or representation of virtue, that sees with joy
the unmerited fall of what had long flourished in splendor
and in honor." Thus, too, the imagination is an accomplice
of time, as well as of the law of subordination; indeed,
its deepest and noblest function lies in its power of
carrying what was once seen and known as a living portion
and factor of the present, and there is no surer test
of the quality of a man's mind than the degree in which
he feels the long-remembered past as one of the vital and
immediate laws of his being. So it is that the imagination
is the chief creator and sustainer of the great memorial
institutions of society, such as the Crown and the Church
and the other pageantries of state, which are the very
embodiment of prescription, as it were the soul of tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
taking form and awful authority among the living.
How deeply Burke felt this prescriptive right of the imagination,
no one need be told; nor is it necessary to quote
in full the familiar passages in which he likens the British
monarchy, with its bulwark of nobility, to "the proud
keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and
girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers,"
or calls on the Church to "exalt her mitred front in courts
and parliaments." There is the true Burke; he knew, as
Paine knew, that the support of these institutions was
in their symbolic sway over the imaginations of men, and
that, with this defence undermined, they would crumble
away beneath the aggressive passions of the present, or
would remain as mere bloodless vanities. He thought that
the real value of life was in its meaning to the imagination,
and he was not ashamed to avow that the fall and tragedy
of kings, because they bore in their person the destiny of
ancient institutions, stirred him more profoundly than
the sufferings of ordinary men.</p>

<p>It is perfectly easy for a keen and narrow intelligence
to ridicule Burke's trust in the imagination, but as a
matter of fact there is nothing more practical than a clear
recognition of its vast domain in human affairs&mdash;it was
Napoleon Bonaparte who said that "imagination rules
the world." Burke is not dead; his pages are an inexhaustible
storehouse of inspiration and wisdom. But it
is true nevertheless, that his ideas never quite freed themselves
from their matrix, and that in his arguments the
essential is involved in the contingent. Though he saw
clearly enough the imperfections of the actual union of a
prescriptive and a natural aristocracy, he was not able,
with all his insight, to conceive the existence of the latter
alone and by virtue of its own rights. He cried out that
the age of chivalry was gone; he saw that the age of prescription,
however it might be propped up for a time, was
also doomed, not only in France but in his England as
well, and with that away there was nothing for his imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but an utter blank. As a consequence the problem
of government for us to-day in its fundamental aspects
is really closer to the exposition of the Greek philosopher
two thousand years ago, than to that of the modern English
statesman. We have the naked question to answer:
How shall a society, newly shaking itself free from a disguised
plutocratic régime, be guided to suffer the persuasion
of a natural aristocracy which has none of the
insignia of an old prescription to impose its authority?
Shall the true justice prevail, which by a right discrimination
would confer power and influence in accordance with
inner distinction; or shall that so-called justice prevail&mdash;for
no man acknowledges open injustice&mdash;which recommends
itself as equality of opportunity, but in practice,
by confusing the distinctions of age, sex, and character,
comes at last to the brutal doctrine that might makes
right, whether that might be the material strength of
money or the jealous tyranny of numbers?</p>

<p>Leaders there will be, as there always have been.
Leaders there are now, of each class, and we know their
names. We still call the baser sort a demagogue, and
his definition is still what it was among those who invented
the term: "a flatterer of the people." Or, if that description
seems too vague, you will recognize him as one who
unites in himself enormous physical and mental activity,
yet who employs his extraordinary talents in no serious
way for the comfort and sustenance of the higher
life of the imagination, but for running about restlessly
and filling the public mind with stentorian alarms.
He is one who proclaims ostentatiously that the first
aim of government "must always be the possession by
the average citizen of the right kind of character," and
then, in his own person, gives an example of identifying
character with passion by betraying a friend and malignantly
misinterpreting his words, as soon as that friend
may be decried for balking the popular will&mdash;and balking
the path of the decrier's ambition. He is one who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
been honored as the leader of a great political party, and
then, as soon as he is dethroned from its leadership,
denounces that same party as the tool of privilege
and the source of corruption. He is one who in proclaiming
the principles of his new party, has constantly
on his lips the magical word "justice," which
he defines by the specious phrase "equality of opportunity,"
yet in the end identifies justice with the removal
of all checks from government so that the desire of the
majority may be immediately carried out, whether right
or wrong. For "it is impossible to invent constitutional
devices which will prevent the popular will from being
effective for wrong without also preventing it from being
effective for right. The only safe course to follow in this
great American democracy is to provide for making the
popular judgment really effective."</p>

<p>To this end our exemplary demagogue would take away
every obstacle between the opinion of the moment and the
enactment of that opinion into law. Hence the initiative
and referendum.</p>

<p>Above the legislators is the Constitution, devised in
order that legislation upon any particular question may
be made to conform essentially with what has been laid
down on deliberation as the wisest general course of
government. It is a check upon hasty action, and implies
a certain distrust of the popular judgment at any moment
when passion or delusion may be at play. Therefore our
demagogue will denounce reverence for the Constitution
as a fetich. Blithely ignoring the fact that Constitution-making
and remaking is one of the pastimes of some
States, and that even the Federal Constitution can be
amended with none too great difficulty when the opinion
of the people is really formed (as in the recent case of the
election of senators), he will earnestly call upon the Constitutional
Convention of Ohio "to provide in this Constitution
means which will enable the people readily to
amend it if at any point it works injustice"; and then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
if that provision were not sufficient to relax its mortmain,
he will virtually abrogate its function of imposing any
check whatsoever by adding "means which will permit
the people themselves by popular vote, after due deliberation
and discussion, but finally and without appeal, to
settle what the proper construction of any constitutional
point is"; and this construction is to be made, not legally,
that is by an attempt to get at the actual meaning of the
language used, but in accordance with the current notion
of what is right.</p>

<p>But the full venom of his attack will be directed against
the courts, because in them is impersonated the final
sovereignty of unimpassioned judgment over the fluctuations
of sentiment, and with it the last check upon the
operations of the demagogue. The interpretation of the
law in accordance with the conditions of life is to rest with
the people. If necessary they are to have the power of recalling
the judge who is recalcitrant to their views, and
at the least they are to have opportunity to reverse any
decision of the courts which seems to them wrong. In this
way he thinks to ensure "an independent judiciary"!
To enforce the need of the recall he accuses the courts of
"refusing to permit the people of the States to exercise
their right as a free people." Thereupon he cites what
he calls a "typical" case in New York, in which the judges
declared a workingmen's compensation act unconstitutional.
"In other words, they insisted that the Constitution
had <i>permanently</i> cursed our people with impotence
to right wrong and had <i>perpetuated</i> a cruel iniquity."
This tirade, followed by the most inflammatory appeals
to the emotions, was uttered in 1912; at the very time
when he was inveighing against the courts for perpetuating
iniquity, the machinery was in train for amending the
Constitution, and in less than two years that permanent
curse was removed by the passage of a constitutional law
in full favor of the workingman. Such is the despotism of
facts. And ever through these vituperative charges runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the high note of flattery: "If the American people are not
fit for popular government, and if they should of right
be the servants and not the masters of the men whom
they themselves put in office!"</p>

<p>The demagogue paints himself. In a word you may
know him by this single trait: he is one who, in the pursuit
of the so-called rights of humanity, has a supreme
contempt for those</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unconcerning things, matters of fact;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>one who, by means of an hypnotic loquaciousness, is constantly
persuading the people that they have only to
follow their first impulsive emotions to be right and safe,
and that as a consequence every institution should be
swept away which in their wiser, calmer moments they
have created as a bulwark against their own more variable
nature. To complete the picture we need to contrast with
it Burke's portrait of the men of light and leading, with his
sober statement of the law of liberty: "Men are qualified
for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to
put moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportion
as their love to justice is above their rapacity; in proportion
as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is
above their vanity and presumption; in proportion as
they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the
wise and good, in preference to the flattery of knaves.
Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will
and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there
is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained
in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate
minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their
fetters." Or we may go further back and look upon
Plato's portrait of the guides who have earned the right
to persuade others to temperance by the diligent exercise
of that virtue in their own lives.</p>

<p>But the most notable example of demagoguery to-day
is not a man, though he be clothed with thunder, but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
institution. There are newspapers and magazines, reaching
millions of readers, which have reduced the art to a
perfect system. Their method is as simple as it is effective:
always appeal to the emotion of the hour, and present
it in terms which will justify its excess. Thus, in times
when there is no wave of international envy disturbing
the popular mind, our journal will print edifying editorials
on brotherly love, and laud the people as the great source
of peace among nations. But let some racial dispute arise,
as in the months preceding our Spanish war or the Italian
raid on Africa, and this same journal will day after day
use its editorial columns to inflame national hatred&mdash;and
increase its circulation. On days when no sensational
event has occurred, it will indulge in the prettiest sentimental
sermons on the home and on family felicities.
Nothing so moral; it will even plead in lacrimose type
against the evil of allowing babies to lie in perambulators
with their eyes exposed to the sun. But let the popular
mind be excited by some crime of lust, and the same

sitting somewhere in secret conclave, plotting,
plotting, to pervert the government. Our public crimes

<p>These are the agencies that, in varying forms, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
at work in many ages. Only now we have formulated
them into a noble maxim, which you will hear daily resounding
in the pulpit and the press and in the street:
"The cure of democracy is more democracy." It is a lie,
and we know it is a lie. We know that this cry of the
demagogue has invariably in the past led to anarchy and
to despotism; and we know that to-day, were these forces
unopposed, as happily they are not unopposed, the same
result would occur&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our liberty reversed and charters gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we made servants to Opinion.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The remedy for the evils of license is not in the elimination
of popular restraint, but precisely in bringing the people
to respect and follow their right leaders. The cure of
democracy is not <i>more</i> democracy, but <i>better</i> democracy.</p>

<p>Nor is such a cure dependent primarily on the appearance,
in a community, of men capable of the light: for
these the world always has, and these we too have in
abundance; it depends rather on so relating these select
natures to the community that they shall be also men of
leading. The danger is lest, in a State which bestows influence
and honors on its demagogues, the citizens of
more refined intelligence, those true philosophers who have
discourse of reason, and have won the difficult citadel of
their own souls, should withdraw from public affairs and
retire into that citadel, as it were into an ivory tower.
The harm wrought by such a condition is twofold: it
deprives the better minds of the larger sustenance of
popular sympathy, producing among them a kind of
intellectual <i>préciosité</i> and a languid interest in art as a
refuge from life instead of an integral part of life; and, on
the other hand, it tends to leave the mass of society a prey
to the brutalized emotions of indiscriminate pleasure-seeking.
In such a State distinction becomes the sorry
badge of isolation. The need is to provide for a natural
aristocracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it must be clearly understood that in advocating
such a measure, at least under the conditions that actually
prevail to-day, there is involved no futile intention of
abrogating democracy, in so far as democracy means
government by and of the people. A natural aristocracy
does not demand the restoration of inherited privilege
or a relapse into the crude dominion of money; it is not
synonymous with oligarchy or plutocracy. It calls rather
for some machinery or some social consciousness which
shall ensure the selection from among the community at
large of the truly "best," and the bestowal on them of
"power"; it is the true consummation of democracy. And,
again, it must be said emphatically that this is not an
academic question, dealing with unreal distinctions. No
one supposes that the "best" are a sharply defined class,
moving about among their fellows with a visible halo
above them, and a smile of beatific superiority on their
faces. Society is not made of such classifications, and
governments have always been of a more or less mixed
character. A natural aristocracy signifies rather a tendency
than a conclusion; and in such a sense it was taken,
no doubt, by my sociological friend of radical ideas who
pronounced it the great practical problem of the day.</p>

<p>The first requisite for solving this problem is that those
who are designed by nature, so to speak, to form an
aristocracy should come to an understanding of their own
belief. There is a question to be faced boldly: What
is the true aim of society? Does justice consist primarily
in leveling the distribution of powers and benefits, or in
proportioning them to the scale of character and intelligence?
Is the main purpose of the machinery of government
to raise the material welfare of the masses, or to
create advantages for the upward striving of the exceptional?
Is the state of humanity to be estimated by numbers,
or is it a true saying of the old stoic poet: <i>humanum
paucis vivit genus</i>? Shall our interest in mankind begin
at the bottom and progress upward, or begin at the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and progress downward? To those who feel that the time
has come for a reversion from certain present tendencies,
the answer to this question cannot be doubtful. Before
anything else is done we must purge our minds of the
current cant of humanitarianism. This does not mean
that we are to deny the individual appeals of pity, and
introduce a wolfish egotism into human relations. On the
contrary it is just the preaching of false humanitarian
doctrines that practically results in weakening the response
to rightful obligations and "turning men's duties into
doubts," and thus throws the prizes of life to the hard
grasping materialist and the coarse talker. In the end the
happiness of the people also, in the wider sense, depends
on the common recognition of the law of just subordination.
But, whatever the ultimate effect of this sort may
be, the need now is to counterbalance the excess of emotional
humanitarianism, with an injection of the truth&mdash;even
the contemptuous truth. Let us, in the name of a
long-suffering God, put some bounds to the flood of talk
about the wages of the bricklayer and the trainman, and
talk a little more about the income of the artist and teacher
and public censor who have taste and strength of character
to remain in opposition to the tide. Let us have less cant
about the great educative value of the theatre for the
people and less humbug about the virtues of the nauseous
problem play, and more consideration of what is clean
and nourishing food for the larger minds. Let us forget
for a while our absorbing desire to fit the schools to train
boys for the shop and the counting-room, and concern
ourselves more effectively with the dwindling of those
disciplinary studies which lift men out of the crowd.
Let us, in fine, not number ourselves among the traitors
to their class who <i>invidiæ metu non audeant dicere</i>.</p>

<p>One hears a vast deal these days about class consciousness,
and it is undoubtedly a potent social instrument.
Why should there not be an outspoken class consciousness
among those who are in the advance of civilization as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
as among those who are in the rear? Such a compact of
mutual sympathy and encouragement would draw the
man of enlightenment out of his sterile seclusion, and
make him efficient; it would strengthen the sense of obligation
among those who hesitate to take sides, and would
turn many despondent votaries of fatalism and many
amateur dabblers in reform to a realization of the deeper
needs of the day. Nor is this an appeal to idle sentiment.
Much is said about the power of the masses and the irresistible
spread of revolutionary ideas from the lower ranks
upward. The facts of history point in quite the other
direction. It was not the plebs who destroyed the Roman
republic, but the corrupt factions of the Senate, and the
treachery of such patricians as Catiline and Julius Cæsar.
In like manner the French Revolution would never have
had a beginning but for the teaching of the philosophers
and the prevalence of equalitarian fallacies among the
privileged classes themselves. The Vicomtesse de Noailles
spoke from knowledge when she said: "La philosophie
n'avait pas d'apôtres plus bienveillants que les grands
seigneurs. L'horreur des abus, le mépris des distinctions
héréditaires, tous ces sentiments dont les classes inférieures
se sont emparées dans leur intérêt, ont dû leur premier
éclat à l'enthousiasme des grands." And so to-day the
real strength of socialistic doctrines is not in the discontent
of the workingmen, but in the faint-hearted submission
of those who by the natural division of society
belong to the class that has everything to lose by revolution,
and in the sentimental adherence of dilettante reformers.
The real danger is after all not so much from
the self-exposed demagogues as from the ignorant tamperers
with explosive material. It is not so much from
the loathsome machinations of the yellow press, dangerous
as they are, as from the journals that are supposed to stand
for higher things, yet in their interest in some particular
reform, support whole-heartedly candidates who flirt
with schemes subversive of property and constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
checks; in their zeal for the brotherhood of man, deal
loosely with facts; and in their clamor for some specious
extension of the franchise, neglect the finer claims of
justice. These men and these journals, betrayers of the
trust, are the real menace. Without their aid and abetment
there may be rumblings of discontent, wholesome
enough as warnings against a selfish stagnation, but there
can be no concerted drive of society towards radical revolution.
For radical forces are by their nature incapable of
any persistent harmony of action, and have only the semblance
of cohesion from a constraining fear or hatred.
The dynamic source of revolution must be in the perversion
of those at the top, and anarchy comes with their
defalcation. Against such perils when they show themselves,
the proper safeguard is the arousing of a counter
class consciousness.</p>

<p>It is a sound theorem of President Lowell's that popular
government "may be said to consist of the control of
political affairs by public opinion." Now there is to-day
a vast organization for manipulating public opinion in
favor of the workingman, and for deluding it in the interest
of those who grow fat by pandering in the name of emancipation
to the baser emotions of mankind; but of organization
among those who suffer from the vulgarizing
trend of democracy there is little or none. As a consequence
we see the conditions of life growing year by year
harder for those whose labor is not concerned immediately
with the direction of material forces or with the supply
of sensational pleasure; they are ground, so to speak,
between the upper and the nether millstone. Perhaps
organization is not the word to describe accurately what
is desired among those who are fast becoming the silent
members of society, for it implies a sharper discrimination
into grades of taste and character than exists in
nature; but there is nothing chimerical in looking for a
certain conscious solidarity at the core of the aristocratical
class (using "aristocratical" always in the Platonic sense),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with a looser cohesion at the edges. Let that class become
frankly convinced that the true aim of a State is, as in
the magnificent theory of Aristotle, to make possible the
high friendship of those who have raised themselves to a
vision of the Supreme Good, let them adopt means to
confirm one another in that faith, and their influence
will spread outward through society, and leaven the
whole range of public opinion.</p>

<p>The instrument by which this control of public opinion
is effected is primarily the imagination; and here we meet
with a real difficulty. It was the advantage of such a
union of aristocracy and inherited oligarchy as Burke
advocated that it gave something visible and definite
for the imagination to work upon, whereas the democratic
aristocracy of character must always be comparatively
vague. But we are not left wholly without the means of
giving to the imagination a certain sureness of range,
while remaining within the forms of popular government.
The opportunity is in the hands of our higher institutions
of learning, and it is towards recalling these to their duty
that the first efforts of reform should be directed. It is
not my intention here to enter into the precise nature of
this reform, for the subject is so large as to demand a
separate essay. In brief, the need is to restore to their
predominance in the curriculum those studies that train
the imagination, not, be it said, the imagination in its
purely æsthetic function, though that aspect of it also
has been sadly neglected, but the imagination in its power
of grasping in a single firm vision, so to speak, the long
course of human history, and of distinguishing what is
essential therein from what is ephemeral. The enormous
preponderance of studies that deal with the immediate
questions of economics and government, inevitably results
in isolating the student from the great inheritance of the
past; the frequent habit of dragging him through the
slums of sociology, instead of making him at home in the
society of the noble dead, debauches his mind with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
flabby, or inflames it with a fanatic, humanitarianism.
He comes out of college, if he has learnt anything, a
<i>nouveau intellectuel</i>, bearing the same relation to the man
of genuine education as the <i>nouveau riche</i> to the man of
inherited manners; he is narrow and unbalanced, a prey
to the prevailing passion of the hour, with no feeling for
the majestic claims of that within us which is unchanged
from the beginning. In place of this excessive contemporaneity
we shall give a larger share of time and honor to the
hoarded lessons of antiquity. There is truth in the Hobbian
maxim that "imagination and memory are but one
thing"; by their union in education alone shall a man acquire
the uninvidious equivalent in character of those
broadening influences which came to the oligarch through
prescription&mdash;he is moulded indeed into the true aristocrat.
And with the assertion of what may be called an inner
prescription he will find among those over whom he is
set as leader and guide a measure of respect which springs
from something in the human breast more stable and
honorable and more conformable to reason than the mere
stolidity of an unreflecting prejudice. For, when everything
is said, there could be no civilized society were it
not that deep in our hearts, beneath all the turbulences
of greed and vanity, abides the instinct of obedience to
what is noble and of good repute. It awaits only the clear
call from above.</p>

<h2>THE RIGHT TO BE AMUSED</h2>


<p>Recent ideas of social justice have been marked
by a vast extension of the category of human
rights. While these new rights are most various they may
all be covered by the general principle that wages may be
of right more than what the wage taker earns for his employer,
and that in all exchanges of any sort between the
poor and the rich the poor has the right to take more
than he gives. To follow the applications of this new
doctrine of rights would be instructive. We should find
that an employer is financially responsible for accidents
occurring through an employee's recklessness. If my
gardener gets drunk and drowns himself in the cistern, I
must pay roundly to his estate. Nor have I the satisfaction,
if it be such, of regarding this contribution as a compulsory
beneficence. It is my gardener's right. The odd
part is that if I, being a professor, get drunk and drown
myself in the campus fountain, the corporation is in no
way bound to assuage my widow's financial need. If
the corporation should, by way of embalming my memory,
grant her a pension, it would be a case not of her rights
but of their charity. This perfectly possible instance
reveals an odd reversal of all earlier doctrines of rights.
It used to be supposed that rights increased with capacity.
Now the more incapable a person may be, the more completely
the state invests him with rights. Ability and
power must be carefully hemmed in with duties. Weakness
on the contrary is freed from duties and must be
privileged.</p>

<p>Into what moral gulf we are thus cheerfully staggering
it would be a high public service to inquire. But my theme
is not so ambitious. I wish merely to suggest in a particular
instance the somewhat woeful reaction of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
new doctrine of rights upon a certain class of the weak&mdash;to
wit, ill balanced and discontented women. I have
witnessed many cases of personal unhappiness among
women, some of domestic shipwreck, owing to a wife's
moral confusion, some of women hounded by unreasonable
discontent into public careers for which they have
no capacity, and perhaps the most pitiful cases of all,
women pursued by an aimless restiveness which finds no
stated expression, but colors atrociously their every act.
Peace and clear thinking wither as those women pass.
They are mostly victims of a false theory that a woman
has the innate right to be amused, and that for such amusement
she need not pay. It will be seen that I have described
what foreign neurologists call <i>la maladie Américaine</i>.
And as a matter of fact the fallacy that a right to be
amused exists, is more prevalent in America than elsewhere.
Let us admit that Mrs. Wharton's Undine Spragg
is overdrawn, she still retains high symbolic value. As
Americans we may doubt her in parts, but we cannot
disown her as a whole. She is the bright archangel of the
dogma that while a woman must be amused, she need not
pay.</p>

<p>At the outset we must discriminate sharply the right to
be amused, from the ordinary pursuit of pleasure. The
most reckless or voluptuous programme of life assumes
in contrast a certain dignity and morality, from the fact
that the pleasure seeker is prepared to take all risks and
pay all prices. That is the man's code the world over,
and in most countries it has imposed itself upon the community
generally. It is a poor code enough as compared
with self control and social service, but at least it has
glimmerings of generosity and justice. The strong at
all times have managed to live pretty satisfactorily by
it. The weak have not suffered unduly under the rule
of he who breaks must pay. Quite apart from the Epicurean
programme, all sensible people work on a theory
of reciprocity in service and in pleasure. I can't expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
nice people to seek me unless I now and then seek them.
If I am habitually silent or merely garrulous, I have no
claim upon the good talker; he will properly flee my approach.
So for the person who is not amusing there can
be no right to be amused, and if he succeeds nevertheless
in extorting amusement from the world, it is at somebody
else's expense, and at the cost of his own soul.</p>

<p>What I frequently see in the faces of women, and especially
in the faces of young girls of the wealthy classes,
is as distressing to me as mysterious. It has been my
rare good fortune to live among serene and companionable
women, women whose graciousness has been rooted in
character. Accordingly I am mystified by the hungry
defiant faces I see about me wherever women congregate.
They seem to be playing a part, to be desperately seeking
something which they are getting in insufficient measure.
They have the air of being ready to resent a slight while
stubbornly maintaining a right. They are too intent.
There is no ease in them and no fragrance. Now if these
observations were of recent date or suddenly made, it
would be prudent to set them down to the score of middle
age and a growing disinclination from general society.
It would be pleasant to believe that I am merely become
old fashioned, mistaking Paris modes for inner characteristics,
and particular cosmetic arts which the young girls of
my youth happened not to employ, for a sign of degeneracy.
Whereas, it may still be a true heart, the beating of which
one observes too plainly at opera or dance, and rouge
tinges nothing but the skin. So I would fain believe that
the readiness with which our women assume the stigmata
of the Paris half-world, is without significance. "The
Ladies! God bless them!" it would be pleasant to end
this ungracious discourse with the familiar toast. But
the toast itself no longer is pledged with the old unction,
and the modern woman is too intelligent to be satisfied
with stale and perfunctory oblations. She knows that
not all is well with her, and welcomes the probe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
satirists of our womenkind would starve but for women
readers. I who am no satirist, but a simple observer of
life, shall have my best reading from women, or shall go
unread.</p>

<p>That defiant hungry look on our young girls' faces, so
different from the shyness and wistfulness one generally
notes in Europe, what is its ground? A complete answer
would mean the writing of a considerable chapter of our
history. One would trace the course of happy laborious
partnerships in pioneer times, to the establishment of
wealth, and the institution of a peculiar American cult of
womanhood. This cult found expression in eloquent
cant phrases. "Every American woman is a queen in
her own household" was a favorite article of the liturgy.
More economically expressive was the phrase "able to
support a wife," a wife obviously being regarded as a
luxury of the more expensive order. Along with the cult
went a resolute practice of keeping all business or political
cares from the women of the family. Such reticence as
to the real issues of living, such exclusion from the
usual means of education, was the lot of the American
woman from early in the last century. She was, in another
favorite liturgical phrase, exclusively, "The ornament
of the home." Naturally her education was to
consist wholly of accomplishments. Money poured into
her hands and out. Whence it came, and the difficulty
of getting it, were scrupulously concealed from her. To
be a good provider was the cardinal masculine merit.
For the husband the money grubbing realities; for the
wife the decorative appearances. Very soon it became a
tacit convention that, already separated in all ordinary
business relations, husband and wife should be separated
also in their pleasures. He was too dull or too tired for
society, but from his fireside or club chair took a remotely
conjugal satisfaction in the report of her brilliancy and
social successes: for after all he was subsidizing her career.
To be the husband of a very successful woman was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
being the background angel for a theatrical star. It
implied association and interest, but nothing like intimacy.
Being reduced to a scintillant parasitic role, the
American woman, to do her justice, played it pretty
well. The literature and general discussions of the sixties
and seventies abound in her laudation, while the American
man is either charitably ignored or briefly commended
for his self effacing virtues and unlimited generosity as
a provider. It was in this black walnut era, which corresponds
exactly with the high point of the cult of the American
woman, that she became a familiar apparition in
the hotels of Europe. Ostensibly she was cultivating
some accomplishment, or, less specifically, her soul. In
response to an abnormal social position she developed
peculiar capacities. She devoured wholesale miscellaneous
ill assorted information, and gave it back with
interest. She acquired a brittle fluent manner of talk,
but her idea of conversation was to be vivacious and
assertive and above all merely to keep things going. She
created a social atmosphere in which no thoughtful, unaggressive
person could live. The American husband
withdrew more securely into his social nonentity, while
his place was taken by nondescript foreigners or by light
footed and joyous young native male beings who also
had the gift of keeping things up. These radiant young
males for the most part flourished only for a space. In
turn they became occulted husbands and tolerated good
providers.</p>

<p>The women were less fortunate. To be an American
woman was an inexorable career that once undertaken
could not be abandoned. A few escaped by marrying
into the simple human conditions prevailing among the
European aristocracy, some American queens were dethroned
through failure of the exchequer, a few succumbed
to an increasing group of children; these were the fortunate
exceptions. Most of them continued the hopeless
task of building up a satisfactory life without including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the ordinary responsibilities and loyalties. Naturally
the cardinal maxim of a life largely empty of real interests
and devoted to self exploitation along social lines, was the
right to be amused. That is what, by and large, the good
looking American woman is taught to regard as her most
peculiar and precious right. That is the meaning of the
hungry and defiant faces of our young girls. They are the
last logical stage in the American notion of womanhood.
They are anxiously asserting a right which the world by
no means always allows&mdash;the right to be amused.</p>

<p>Let me restore a perhaps tottering reputation for humor
by admitting that the picture just sketched is somewhat
overdrawn. There was sometimes a certain unity in
grotesquely sundered families. The organizing and management
of a household in days before the apartment
hotel, the telephone, and the department store, involved
an irreducible minimum of steadying duties. The cult of
the American woman often produced a sense of <i>noblesse
oblige</i>, not very logical but efficacious. The queen could
in the better sense do no wrong. Then there were always
happy backwaters of society where the family was still
an alliance, and mutual understanding was the rule. What
justifies me in blackening the picture, is the fact that the
dogma of the right to be amused is as strong as ever, and
more disastrous in its results. Few duties and educational
offsets help the modern girl to see life clearly and
see it whole. Increasingly detached from all imposed
responsibilities, she is more in danger of regarding the
world as her playground and other men and women as
her toys. The inevitable weakness of her position is that
she has little to give. Her beauty and the charm of her
sex, a certain restless vivacity, are often her sole current
coin. It is a currency subject to rapid depreciation.
After girlhood she frequently is not amusing, has nothing
to give for the amusement become necessary to her. Establishing
no stable and self respecting relations, she flies
about in search of new excitements. Isms and ologies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
claim her passing fealty. Messiahs alternate with neurologists.
To the problems of life she brings the mind of a
spoiled child. If she marries well, she may at least conduct
satisfactorily an expensive will-o'-the-wisp existence.
For amusement by this sort is very exactly graded by its
expensiveness. Large motor cars or yachts, opera boxes,
public dining and dancing&mdash;these are the surest evidence
that one's right to be amused is duly conceded by one's
husband and by the world. Whatever satisfactions the
married butterfly commands are largely denied to her
unwedded sister. I know of no more pitiful spectacle
than that of women in the forties still conducting with a
child's mentality the occupations of girlhood. These
constitute the supporting public for all the charlatanisms&mdash;social,
political, and religious.</p>

<p>Of course I am aware that all babies are born with the
right to be amused&mdash;a right which child specialists have
valiantly but vainly striven to abridge. In the case of a
male baby that right is pretty soon abridged by the
rough and tumble and give and take of school and games.
The sense that he must be amused is soon knocked out
of a normal boy. In a young man whatever may survive
of it yields to the somewhat grim business of earning a
living. In a rich and unoccupied young man, the problem
of amusement is very much that of the woman, with the
marked difference, however, that only a very perverse
young man imagines that amusement is due him, or can
be had on other terms than his paying for it. In comparison
with this wholesome process of gradual enlightenment,
how little is done for the education of a girl! Compare
with the unconditioned freedom of a well to do American
maiden, that stern subjection to the complicated
interest of a clan which is the lot of an English girl, or
better, the rational preparation for marriage and motherhood
which every well born French girl receives. To submit,
to play a social part, to discount pleasure in favor
of duty, this is the very air girls breathe in the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
civilizations. A study or a mere observation of the women of
Europe and America will leave no doubt as to where the
balance of happiness lies. The boasted freedom of the
American woman is often her sorrow, and her joy is escape
from freedom into some kind of service.</p>

<p>This is a trite story. Robert Grant, Edith Wharton,
Robert Herrick have expended the greatest artistry on
the ungrateful theme of the egocentric American woman.
More blatantly, David Graham Phillips, Upton Sinclair,
and Owen Johnson have belabored the unfortunate creature.
I venture to move matter so thoroughly familiar,
only in the hope of setting it in something like historic
perspective, and of pointing out remedial tendencies. And
first of all, while this is primarily a woman's problem, it is
emphatically of man's making. It would be a most curious
and interesting historical study to ascertain just when
and precisely how, the American notion of women as a
luxury and ornament came into being. Until the quite
recent revulsion against the theory, it passed for a beautiful
expression of the innate chivalry of the American
man. It is possible that it is indeed a product of that
peculiar inept sentimentality&mdash;of that impotence in the
field of the emotions&mdash;which frequently accompanies a
life too narrowly devoted to business. In affairs involving
the intelligence of the heart, there is notoriously no fool
comparable with a certain type of millionaire. An unkinder
view of this chivalric delusion of the American man
as regards his womankind, is that it is not a delusion at all
but a Machiavellian policy. He is overconcentrated in
work, and socially inert. He bribes his women in order to
be let alone. He dangles vanities before them in order to
avoid a manly sharing of his life. The Undine Spraggs
and her sisters in fiction are prone to take this view when
they go to the rare pains of general reflection. Probably
a mixture of the two motives would supply the real cause.
Our forefathers did idolize their women, and doubtless
wished to procure them happiness without first taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the trouble to learn where a woman's happiness really
lies. Our forefathers were also over busy men, and willing
to pay handsomely for immunity from ungrateful social
duties. They may have quite honestly desired to simplify
what is a delicate and complicated personal adjustment,
but in so doing they ignored that broad community of
interest which is the vitalizing principle of any successful
marriage. The present iconoclasm concerning our once
idolized women will do very little good until it be clearly
perceived that what is very much the misfortune of the
American woman is also very much the fault of the American
man. When he begins to realize that he is not merely
a provider or patron, but in the fullest sense a partner,
the old sentimentalisms will give way to reality and common
sense.</p>

<p>Meanwhile much is happening to make our women
more capable of genuine partnership. The projection of
millions of women from sheltered homes into business
has been a rude process and fraught with evils, but it
has given to these women some vision of the world of
affairs. Much of our recent humanitarian endeavor
has been hysterical and half-baked, but it has also left a
considerable residuum of genuine new experience and
wisdom. Suffragist and socialist agitation has wavered
between gushing sentimentalisms and benighted fanaticisms,
but it has also been an educational process, revealing,
to hundreds of thousands of women even if in a hectic
light, the real figure of the world. A great deal that is
still raw in these fermentations may eventuate in clearer
ideas of social justice and personal wisdom. In a very
true sense much of the revolt of women has been an unconscious
protest against the theory of man as paymaster
general. When men understand that women cannot live
by frocks and functions alone, however generously provided,
but want companionship, less will be heard about
feminism and more about humanity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is the duty of parents to disabuse their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
female offspring as to the existence of a right to be amused.
To be amused is at best a privilege conditional upon
one's desire to prove amusing to others. Amusement is
necessary, but less necessary than it seems, and always
has to be paid for fairly. It seems as if such ideas could
be instilled into children, substituting a general morality
and sense of fair play, for the old pseudo-chivalric notion
of sex privilege. There was more to come of this argument
when I was summoned to the telephone to command
any one of a half a dozen little playmates to come
and see my eight year old daughter. She is temporarily
unoccupied and needs to be amused. When she is a little
older she shall read this article. <i>Fiat justitia!</i> But stop!
When I consider her with many women of my acquaintance,
I am amazed that so much sweetness and efficiency
have after all survived so much false doctrine and so many
unfair kindnesses. The stock is good, if much of the
thinking and training has been bad. Quite sincerely I
toast the Ladies, if not with the old sentimental unction,
at least with the profound conviction that they are worthy
of more substantial guerdon than can ever be compacted
from mere profits, dividends, and coupons. I will be
more of a companion to her who has ever been that to
me, and more of a comrade too for the little girl who
wants to be amused.</p>

<h2>HOW WOMAN SUFFRAGE HAS WORKED</h2>


<p>That the results of applied woman suffrage may
stand out the more clearly, it will be expedient
to show, first, the results achieved in behalf of woman
without its help. All are agreed that during the sixty-five
years that have elapsed since the suffragists, led by Lucretia
Mott, posted their "Declaration of Sentiments" at
Seneca Falls, N. Y., in 1848, woman has gained certain
rights and privileges. That Declaration contained a bitter
indictment by woman of man who had "oppressed
her on all sides." He had made her, if married, "in the
eye of the law, civilly dead," having taken from her "all
right in property, even to the wages she earns." He had
made her "morally an irresponsible;" she could commit
many crimes with impunity, "provided they be done in
the presence of her husband, he becoming to all intents
and purposes her master&mdash;the law giving him power to
deprive her of her liberty and to administer chastisement."
He had so framed the laws of divorce as to what should be
the proper causes, and, in case of separation, to whom
the guardianship of the children should be given, "as
to be wholly regardless of the happiness of women&mdash;the
law in all cases going upon the false supposition of the
supremacy of man, and giving all power into his hands."</p>

<p>The married woman having no rights, the single woman
was "taxed to support a Government which recognizes her
only when her property can be made profitable to it."
Man had "monopolized nearly all the profitable employments;"
and from those woman was permitted to follow,
"she receives but a scanty remuneration." Man had
closed to woman "all the avenues to wealth and distinction
which he considers most honorable to himself: as a teacher
of theology, in medicine, or law, she is not known." Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
man had "denied to her the facilities for obtaining a
thorough education, all colleges being closed against her."
In the Church, too, she was subordinated, and apostolic authority
was invoked "for her exclusion from the ministry,
and, with some exceptions, from any public participation
in the affairs of the Church." Men acted by a different
code of morals from women, "by which moral delinquencies
which exclude women from society are not only tolerated,
but deemed of little account in men." By such
means, the indictment declared, man had discriminated
against woman, endeavoring in every way he could to "destroy
her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect,
and to make her lead a dependent and abject life."
And because of these things the drawers of the indictment
demanded for women "immediate admission to all the
rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of
the United States."</p>

<p>It was first of all as voters that the women should gain
the rights denied them. Deprivation of the vote was the
fundamental evil. The first item of their grievances
named the ballot as their "inalienable right." It was
primarily because this had been wrested away, the Declaration
said, that man had been able to oppress woman
on all sides.</p>

<p>But it needs only the restatement of the original suffragist
grievances to show how completely woman has
been emancipated since they were formulated, and chiefly
without the vote. Nowhere in the United States is the
married woman, in the eyes of the law, civilly dead.
Nowhere is she bereft of the right in property and wages.
In that year 1848 when the "Declaration of Sentiments"
was drafted, New York State, still withholding the franchise
from woman, expressly permitted married women
to hold property for their sole and separate use. By a
law of 1861, married women in New York received power
to control property, including wages, and authority to will
property was given them in 1867. By 1887 the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
rights of married women in this State were more complete
than those of their husbands, who could not convey real
estate without their wives' consent. Woman now has a
right of action for injuries to person or property, and she
is liable for her own wrongful acts; that is, she is no longer
"morally an irresponsible." Women are joint guardians
with their husbands of their minor children, and, in case
of divorce, the custody of the children is decreed reasonably
to the innocent party without discrimination as to
sex. The laws of divorce and separation, too, though
differing widely in the several States, are impartial, applying
equally to men and women. New York's women taxpayers
have the right to vote on questions of local taxation
in all towns and villages, and they are eligible to nearly
all political offices, and to various positions of trust and
responsibility. Moreover, all the professions are open
to them.</p>

<p>In these respects, the case of New York is fairly typical
of all the States in the Union, whether suffragist or non-suffragist.
As for men's monopolizing "nearly all the
profitable employments," the Federal census of 1900
showed that women were engaged in 295 out of the 303
masculine occupations. The original complaint that they
were not admitted to men's pursuits on equal terms with
men has changed to a demand for laws which shall discriminate
in favor of women in industry because of their
weaker physique. Only in Massachusetts, Indiana, and
Nebraska, however, three male-suffrage States, have laws
been passed prohibiting night work for women in factories
and machine shops. The eight-hour law for women
in California was enacted before they had the suffrage
there, but it still exempts the great canning industry of
that State from its operation, and it does not prohibit
night work. The doubtful minimum wage act, and the
maternity act for the protection of women were first
copied from anti-feminist Europe by male-suffragist
Massachusetts. Massachusetts, also, is generally credited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
by child labor experts and by woman suffragists with
having the best child labor law in the Union, applied in
her great textile industries. It would seem, therefore,
that the added complaint of the latter-day suffragists
of lack of discrimination in favor of working women may
be satisfied without resort by them to the ballot.</p>

<p>The facilities for acquiring a thorough education are
now in no State denied to woman. In the argument of
Mrs. A. J. George to the woman suffrage committee of
the Federal Senate on April 19, 1913, this anti-suffragist
authority noted the fact that there are "to-day more
institutions which grant degrees to women in this country
than there are institutions which grant degrees to men."
The foundation of Vassar, of Wellesley, of Smith, of Mount
Holyoke, was "in no way connected with the suffrage
movement," while the opening of the Harvard examinations
to women and the opening of the graduate departments
of Yale University to women were due to the
activities of men and women who were avowed anti-suffragists.
In the universal granting of this great
privilege to woman, therefore, the ballot was not used or
needed.</p>

<p>The grievance that woman is subordinated in the
Church was one that, by its nature, could not be settled
by the suffrage, since in this country Church and State
are irrevocably separate. As a matter of fact, however,
woman has steadily gained rights and privileges in most
denominations of the Protestant Church, including admission
to the ministry and public participation in their
affairs. For example, Dr. Anna Shaw, the President of
the National Woman's Suffrage Association, is a clergywoman.
As in religion, so in morals. The legal prohibitions
of immorality are in most cases the same for both
men and women; it is only outside the domain of legislation
and within the sphere of social custom that divergencies
appear, and here the discrimination is exercised
notoriously by woman against her erring sisters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to this point results achieved and practicable without
the suffrage seem to argue strongly against a continuance
of the propaganda to obtain the elective franchise
for the redress of aggrieved womankind. Clothed with
full rights in property and earnings, held morally accountable
for her acts, made joint guardian with her
husband over her children, welcomed to an equal competition
with men in business, industry, and the professions,
after ample opportunities given for acquiring a higher
education and special training, to what further extent
can the exercise of the voting power by woman improve
her status? The grievances set forth in the "Declaration
of Sentiments" of 1848 present the "whole case for woman
as comprehensively as it ever has been stated since," according
to an official statement of the National Woman
Suffrage Association; the document's resolutions comprised
"practically every demand that ever afterwards
was made for women." The civil and legal rights besought
therein have been so fully recognized that the
anti-suffragists, numbering many public-spirited women
who have battled zealously for these rights, now contend
that womanhood suffrage is not needed.</p>

<p>Their suffragist opponents will not be gainsaid. While
the condition of woman and her children has been mitigated,
much remains to do, they say, and the more quickly
by the ballot. For example, while eighteen States, comprising
nearly one-half the population of the Union&mdash;41,231,000,
to be exact&mdash;enjoy the benefit of joint guardianship
laws, and in twenty-seven more States the surviving
mother is made sole guardian of her children with
the same powers exercised by the father in his lifetime, six
States remain&mdash;Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee,
Virginia, and Maryland, with a combined population of
9,104,000&mdash;in which the father has power to bequeath the
guardianship to a stranger and away from the mother.
To be sure, in this ninth of the population of the country
the custom ignores the common law; husbands uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
leave the guardianship of children to their wives, and the
mother shares authority over them with the father. But
here is a field for corrective legal action. The question is
whether, if women had the vote, this would be the swiftest
and most direct means of bringing about the reform demanded.
A suffragist writer has said: "It took the
mothers of Massachusetts fifty-five years to get an equal
guardianship law, but after the women obtained the ballot
in Colorado the very next Legislature enacted one." She
forgot that New York's joint guardianship law was passed
a year before the Colorado statute. Mrs. George W.
Townsend of Buffalo, who as head of the Woman's Educational
and Industrial Union was active in urging the
passage of the joint guardianship laws in both States,
says of the one in New York:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our Union was especially careful that the Suffrage Association
should not know of the Union's effort until after the law
was passed. I remember that a prominent suffragist called to
see me as soon as she heard of it, and said, "How did you accomplish
this great good, and not let us know?" And I answered,
"Because we did not let you know." I think I was
justified in saying that, because many men in both houses were
so opposed to woman suffrage that they would not have voted
for our bills. The guardianship bill was passed without a negative
vote in either house.</p>

<p>The work was done in a systematic manner. Circulars giving
full information in regard to laws in other States, and as to
what we desired to accomplish, and reasons therefor, were sent
to every legislator. There was no lobbying, and, in fact, it
was not necessary for me to go to Albany at all.</p></blockquote>

<p>It should be noted in this connection that in Wyoming,
while it is not among the "benighted" states that permit
the father to will the guardianship of his children away
from the mother, the women have had an equal voice in
the State Government for more than half a century without
making fathers and mothers joint guardians of their
children. It is not clear, therefore, that joint guardianship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
laws have been passed the more quickly by reason of
woman suffrage.</p>

<p>But other tests should be applied. The new complaints
of woman that have arisen since the Declaration of 1848
deal largely with her condition in the industries which
men have thrown open to her. Has the suffrage enabled
her more quickly to ameliorate this condition? Around
this point the strife rages between the "pros" and the
"antis." Miss Minnie Bronson, who was employed from
1907 to 1909 by the Federal Bureau of Labor to investigate
the conditions of labor of women and children, and
who acted as the Special Agent of the Bureau to report
on the strike of shirtwaist makers in 1910 has prepared a
statement for the Massachusetts Association Opposed to
the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women embodying
a comparison of the laws for the protection of wage-earning
women in the various States of the Union. Miss
Bronson's contentions have been deemed of sufficient
importance to merit a reply, with an introduction by Jane
Addams, written by the two best qualified woman suffragist
authorities on women in the industries, Miss Edith
Abbott of Hull House, Chicago, and Professor Sophonisba
P. Breckinridge of the University of Chicago. The allegations
of Miss Bronson and the specific replies of her
opponents thereto are marshaled below:</p>

<tr><td align="left">A suffragist addressing the
women shirtwaist strikers in
New York declared that if the
women engaged in this industry
had had the ballot such a
strike as theirs would be unnecessary.
The speaker would
have been surprised to learn
that 40 per cent, of the strikers
were men, 36 per cent,
were women under 21 years,
and 6 per cent. were women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>workers of voting age who
had not been in this country
long enough to gain a residence.</td>
    <td align="left">When we say that if women
had a vote there would be an
end of child labor, and that
young girls would work shorter
hours, this does not mean that
we think the children in the
mills and factories and workshops
are going to be allowed
to vote. In England conditions
improved for all workingmen
when some workmen
got the vote; in this country
when some women get the
vote conditions for all workingwomen
will improve.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Laws governing the labor of
women are constantly improved,
not because women
have the ballot or want it, but
because women are entering
more and more into the industrial
life of the country. In
forty-four states the laws
for safeguarding wage-earning
women are better and more
comprehensive than the laws
for the safeguarding of wage-earning
men. Moreover, a
comparison of the labor laws
of the various states shows
that there are more and better
laws for the protection of
women wage-earners in the
non-suffrage states than in
states where women have the
ballot.</td>
    <td align="left">Any fair-minded person
need only recall the long series
of statutes enacted in all the
leading industrial states, covering
nearly three-fourths of a
century, as a result of workmen's
efforts to get through
laws a larger measure of justice
than they could obtain
through their attempts to bargain
with individual employers.
This legislation, although
it may in a few cases protect
the workingwoman as well as
the workingman, represents
the results of long years of
earnest struggle by workingmen
with votes to improve
their condition. Miss Bronson
ignores this, laying stress on
the fact that some states have
a few special provisions to protect
wage-earning women from
exploitation likely to injure
health and endanger their children's
health.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In thirty-four states laws
have been passed limiting the
hours of labor in which a
woman may be employed.
Three of the four woman
suffrage states where women
have voted long enough to
affect legislation have no such
law, and the 54-hour law in
Utah was not enacted until
1911, fifteen years after woman
suffrage became operative
there.</td>
    <td align="left">No suffragist would deny
that protective legislation has
been obtained in states where
women do not vote. It is well
known that most of this legislation
was obtained through
the laborious efforts of suffragists.<br />
No argument that protective
legislation does not exist
in some of the states in which
women have the ballot is
valid which ignores the special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>needs of these states. Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho and
Utah are all mining and agricultural
states and have very
few wage-earning women who
are employed in factories.
Massachusetts had 152,713
women in "manufacturing and
mechanical pursuits" when
the last United States Census
of Occupations was taken;
Idaho had only 681. A similar
contrast might be drawn for
any of the other states: thus,
Wyoming had 501 women in
industrial occupations while
New York in the same year
had 136,788.</td></tr>

employers in stores, factories,
shops, etc., to provide seats

Idaho, that fails to provide
seats for saleswomen had 153
saleswomen in all at a time

New York, 30,858. In most
of the thirty-nine states where
voteless women have secured
these laws, they have never
received the means of enforcing
them. The protective
laws protect no one.</td></tr>

forty-eight hours a week,
passed both laws while under

culmination of forty years of
effort by indirect influence to
improve conditions for women
in industry. Utah in 1911
passed a nine-hour law for
women after less than two
years of effort by its advocates.
The first legislature
of which they asked it gave it
to women with votes. Of the
non-suffrage states not one

women, and only five have
nine-hour laws.</td></tr>

The fact that Colorado has
no Sunday labor law argues
as much against suffrage for
men as for women, since the
men in the large metal-working
establishments are chiefly
affected by absence of Sunday
laws. Anyway, such laws are
rarely enforced.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">An eight-hour law for
women was enacted in Colorado
in 1903, a very inadequate
law, for it was restricted
in its application to women
who must stand at work, and
exempted the great majority
of women employed in that
state in the "seated trades" of
ready-made clothing, dress-making,
millinery and like
occupations, and in candy-making,
box-making, and
cigar-making. The law was
pronounced unconstitutional
in 1907 by the Supreme Court
of Colorado, although state
courts and the Federal Supreme
Court have upheld similar
laws in neighboring male-suffrage
states. Not until
1912, nineteen years after
woman suffrage came into
Colorado, was a law finally
secured limiting the hours of
women at work.</td>
    <td align="left">The eight-hour day of the
Colorado law, made for the
majority of workingwomen of
Colorado a forty-eight-hour
week, in contrast with the
60-hour week in the neighboring
states of Oklahoma, South
Dakota, North Dakota, and
Nebraska. It is little short of
ridiculous to discuss these laws
as if they were all genuinely
protective through proper
enforcement. The last census
of occupations showed but 65
women and girls in Colorado
employed in candy-making,
11 in box-making, and 30 in
cigar-making, in contrast to
1,184 saleswomen, 762 waitresses,
1,599 in hand and steam
laundries,&mdash;all in the standing
trades.</td></tr>

Massachusetts prohibiting employers
from deducting the
wages of women when time is
lost because machinery has
broken down, and prohibiting
the employment of women for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>a fixed period before and after
childbirth; the law in Delaware
and Louisiana exempting
the wages of women from
execution, and laws in California,
Illinois, and Washington,
providing that no person
shall on account of sex be disqualified
from entering upon
or pursuing any lawful business,
vocation, or profession.</td>
    <td align="left">The Massachusetts law relating
to broken-down machinery
was passed to correct
peculiar abuses in the textile
industries. This law was not
needed in suffrage states. In
a few states the courts took
the position that since women
were not voters they could
not become practicing lawyers;
corrective statutes were
passed. No such law would
be needed in a state where
women do participate in the
Government.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">A suffragist says that in
Massachusetts the average
pay of a female teacher is only
one-third that of a male
teacher, and in almost all the
states it is unequal, whereas
Wyoming and Utah give equal
pay for equal work. Where
teachers are doing the same
grade of work no such percentage
as three to one obtains in
Massachusetts. Female teachers
do not in the majority of
cases receive the same pay as
men for the work of the same
grade; but here the law of
supply and demand is paramount.
The women teachers
of New York City receive
equal pay with men teachers,
granted by a male-suffrage
legislature.</td>
    <td align="left">The doctrine of the inflexibility
and almost sacred character
of supply and demand is
outworn. The supply of child
labor has been greatly reduced
in many states, and is
entirely cut off in others by
means of protective legislation;
in still other states the
demand for child labor has
greatly decreased as the result
of inconvenient protective
child labor laws and the demand
for labor of men and
women has correspondingly
increased. To get equal pay
the women teachers in New
York City had to put in six
years of hard and exhausting
work by "indirect influence"
while in the suffrage states
the same result has come about
almost automatically.</td></tr>

<p>In this conflicting testimony it does not appear that
the complaint of Lucretia Mott and her sister suffragists
in 1848 that woman had been oppressed on all sides is
valid to-day. Both Miss Bronson and her suffragist
opponents agree that woman in industry has been protected,
not oppressed. It is admitted that this is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
result of the exercise of the ballot by woman. It is unfortunate,
of course, that the suffrage states are in the agricultural
and mining stages of civilization, and cannot
show how formidable the women's vote might be in correcting
the oppressive man-made laws. It is a little deplorable,
too, that the women in the male-suffrage states
should have spent so much of their time proving that
protective laws might be gotten by the despised indirect
methods. Dr. Abbott and Professor Breckinridge have
perceived this tactical error, and they note it in these
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>American women would probably have got the vote long ago
if they had followed the present English method of making
suffrage a paramount issue, first, last, and all the time. Instead
of this, Miss Jane Addams in Illinois, Mrs. Florence Kelley in
New York, and a host of other ardent suffragists have labored
with the greatest devotion and self-sacrifice to secure protective
legislation for women and children. How much effort they
have put into it, how much time and energy it has cost, only
those who have been closely associated with them know. It
should not be forgotten that, as the result of their experience,
they say that the ballot is the swiftest and surest way to bring
about the reforms which are asked by and for the women workers
of the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>But how can that last sentence be verified? Was it not
explicitly admitted that the suffrage states, by reason of
their mining and agricultural status, have had little occasion
to reform the laws for women workers, and that
the reforms have all been worked out in the east? The
male workers under male suffrage have done this for
themselves, and incidentally for the women workers
among them. Of course, there are fewer woman bread-winners,
the proportion being five men to one woman.
But women share equally in the benefits of labor legislation,
besides being specially protected. The unions have
even succeeded in leveling up a little the scale of women's
wages, thus measurably meeting the complaint of 1848<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
that in her employments woman "receives but a scanty
remuneration." And despite the equal pay laws for
teachers in the suffrage states the average pay for women
teachers is much below that of men teachers. Dr. Helen
M. Sumner, the suffragist writer of the book <i>Equal
Suffrage</i> says: "Taking public employment as a whole,
women in Colorado receive considerably less remuneration
than men;" and "the wages of men and women in all
fields of industry are governed by economic conditions."
Dr. Sumner's tables show that the pay of women in
Colorado has never been quite half as much as the pay of
men; while the average weekly wage of women in that
state is 97 cents higher than the average in the United
States, the average weekly pay of men is $3.62 higher
than for the United States as a whole. Dr. Sumner
frankly acknowledges that the suffrage has probably
nothing to do with the wages of either men or women.</p>

<p>As for hours of work, the contention of the suffragists
that the 54-hour a week law in Massachusetts was "the
culmination of forty years of effort by indirect influence
to improve conditions for women in industry," while Utah
granted such a law after less than two years of effort by
its suffragist advocates, merits the comment that the
forty years, or one-eighth that time, were not consumed in
agitating for this specific bit of legislation. The struggle
for the law limiting hours of women's work in Massachusetts
lasted a little longer than in Utah, chiefly because
Utah is an agricultural state where manufacturers have
less at stake in the passage of such a restrictive measure.
It is not probable that the legislators of Utah blenched
and yielded this point through fear of the women's vote,
or that any but humanitarian motives dictated the legislation
in either state.</p>

<p>Considerations of humanity, indeed, and not politics,
seem to animate the legislative programs for the protection
of women and children in most states, whether male
suffragist or equal suffragist. Pennsylvania, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
is one of the black states on the suffragist maps, because
it has never extended the franchise to woman, even for
the election of school committees. If the woman's vote
is requisite, we should see the protective laws of Pennsylvania
far behind those of Colorado. Colorado has had
equal suffrage since 1893, and of all the woman suffragist
states, conditions there are most nearly like those in the
male suffragist East. For comparison, I draw on two unchallenged
documents, one prepared by Mary C. Bradford
and published by the Colorado Equal Suffrage Association&mdash;with
some additions by Elinor Byrns and Helen
Ranlett, printed in <i>The New York Evening Post</i> of Nov.
10, 1913&mdash;summarizing the protective laws for women
and children passed in that state from 1893 to 1912; the
other, a statement of similar laws in force in Pennsylvania
in 1912, put forth by the Pennsylvania Association Opposed
to Woman Suffrage:</p>

<p>While minor differences exist in this comparison, the
picture as a whole does not show that the legislation protective
of women and children in Colorado is greatly, if
at all, in advance of that in the male-suffrage state of
Pennsylvania. The American Vigilance Association calls
Pennsylvania's laws on "white slavery" and disorderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
houses "good," and Colorado's only "fair." Colorado
created in 1913 a Minimum Wage Commission, thus
coming abreast of male-suffrage Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania lacks such a commission. But a law establishing
a minimum wage is open to the objection that it
throws out of employment all who are incapable of earning
that wage. It does not protect them in industry, it
simply throws them upon the streets, thence to find their
way into jails and poorhouses. Designed as a protective
measure, it has yet to vindicate that purpose, and it seems
to be adopted irrespective of the votes of women. Aside
from this it seems clear that if there is any essential difference
between the protective legislation of Colorado
and Pennsylvania, it must lie in the degree with which
the women's votes compel enforcement of the laws.</p>

<p>But just how effective do the suffragists themselves feel
the women's vote to be in securing redress for their injuries?
Do they trust it? Their chief grievance is the
deprivation of the suffrage. The American Woman
Suffrage Association says of this, nevertheless, that while
woman must have the ballot on every other question, she
cannot be trusted to wield it in deciding this most vital
question of legal privilege; that only an electorate of men
is qualified to decide it. The association is convinced that
every improvement in woman's position thus far has been
secured "not by a general demand from the majority of
women, but by the arguments, entreaties and 'continual
coming' of a persistent few." In the association's <i>Brief
History</i> of the suffrage movement it contends that the
beneficial changes of the last half century in the laws,
written and unwritten, relating to women have necessarily
come by the influence of a few men and women. "Not
one of them would have been made to this day if it had
been necessary to wait until the majority of women asked
for it," the association says. But that is an argument
against the extension of the suffrage, which works only
by majorities!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a valid argument, and it has historical facts in its
support. Massachusetts in 1895 granted woman the
right to vote on the question whether the municipal suffrage
should be extended without distinction of sex. The
suffragists made a vigorous campaign in that state. Only
4 per cent. of the women cared to go to the polls and record
an affirmative vote. When human grievances have become
intolerable, men have been willing to shed blood for
their redress. This grievance of the suffragists cannot be
very widespread or keenly felt, when they fail to persuade
the women even to signify their protest.</p>

<p>She that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also
in much. Mrs. George, speaking for the National Association
Opposed to Woman Suffrage, has presented to
the woman suffrage committee of the Federal Senate the
record of seventeen years' voting for school committees
by the women of Massachusetts. During that time the
registration showed but 4.8 per cent. of all the women of
the state who were qualified to register and vote, and 2.1
per cent., less than one-half of them, actually got to the
polls. Mrs. George obtained from the town clerk of Dedham,
Mass., the official list of male and female voters in that
town from 1889 to 1912, which shows a steadily diminishing
female vote from 154 in 1889 to 1 in 1903; since 1903
not one of the fifty to seventy women registered in Dedham
has remembered to go to the polls on Election Day.</p>

<p>If women cannot be expected to look after the interests
of their children's schooling, how can they be expected to
be faithful in the general field of politics? The Massachusetts
State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage
has compiled the total vote cast in the Presidential election
of 1912 in the six woman suffrage States of California,
Colorado, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho, and Utah&mdash;1,521,590
out of a total possible vote of 3,200,152&mdash;showing
that only 47-1/2 per cent. of men and women in those
states cared to go to the polls for the most interesting of
all elections; comparing this with the 1,587,984 male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
votes cast out of a possible 2,295,119 votes&mdash;69 per cent.
of the total&mdash;in the six non-suffrage western states of
Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Nevada, South Dakota, and
Missouri. Now if 69 per cent. of the men voted in the
woman suffrage states in 1912, then only 17.8 per cent.
of the women voters in those states actually cast their
ballots. At any rate, it is certain that the extension of
suffrage to women results in a notable decrease of the
actual voting strength of the electorate, as compared with
the more healthy interest in voting shown by the electorates
of the non-suffrage states. In that same Presidential
election of 1912, Secretary of State Jordan of California
reports that 802,000 men and but 180,000 women
registered to vote&mdash;over 93 per cent. of the men, and a
trifle over 27 per cent. of the women who were qualified
to register and vote. In the election in Pasadena on
March 20, 1913, deciding bond issues, some of them for
parks and playgrounds, only 4,672 men and women cast
ballots out of a voting population of 16,324; in Los Angeles
four days later, the Citizens' Committee's vigorous campaign
advocating the carrying of certain propositions and
defeat of others ended in a vote of 31,000 men and women,
while 130,000 qualified voters of both sexes stayed away.
Although 45,665 women registered out of 121,000 women
qualified to register and vote in San Francisco's local option
election in 1913, the votes of only 15,087, both men
and women, were cast in favor of the amendment. In all
the elections of which there are records of men and women
voting, the women manifest less interest both in registering
and in voting than the men.</p>

<p>This fact has its vital bearing on the question of law
enforcement. If elected officials fail to enforce the law,
the only corrective is the ballot. Dr. Abbott and Professor
Breckinridge, answering Miss Bronson's statement
that thirty-nine states compel employers in stores, factories,
and shops to provide seats for female employés,
say that in most of the states where voteless women have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
got such laws they have never had the means of enforcing
them. But if the extension of the elective franchise to
the women of these states should mean the lowering of the
total vote from 69 per cent. to but 47-1/2 per cent. of the
possible vote, what prospect is there that the laws will be
better enforced under woman suffrage? Judge Ben B.
Lindsey of Colorado, himself a suffragist by propinquity,
testified in 1910 that his battle with "the Beast" and "the
System" in that state was begun without the help of the
women leaders who at national meetings had been telling
how much the women had done for the juvenile court in
Denver. They dared not help him, Judge Lindsey said,
and women like Mary C. Bradford and Mrs. Lafferty,
a member of the Legislature, "took the platform against
me and supported the System." He added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If anyone believes that woman's suffrage is a panacea for all
the evils of our political life, he does not know what those evils
are. The women are as free of the power of the Beast as the
men are, and no freer.... In a typical American community
such as ours, where the Beast rules, the women are as
helpless as the rest of us.... Their leaders in politics
are politicians; when they get their nominations from corporation
machines they do the work of the corporations; and there
is almost no way under the Beast to get a party nomination except
from a corporation machine. Women in politics are human
beings; they are not "ministering angels" of an ethereal ideality;
and they are unable to free us, because they are not free themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Nora Blatch DeForest has tried to show by tables
that woman's voting benefits women and children in the
passage of laws fixing the "age of consent" for girls; in
fixing the age under which the consent of parent or guardian
is necessary for marriage; the age below which employment
of children in factories is prohibited; the maximum
length of a day's work for children, and the hours
within which women may work in factories. The tabulation
includes the more recent suffrage states of Arizona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
California, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington, in which
most of the beneficial laws enumerated were passed under
male suffrage. In them and in Utah&mdash;excepting the four
other suffrage states where there are no limiting laws for
women's work&mdash;the average day's labor for women is
9.2 hours in the ten suffrage states as against 9.9 hours
in the nineteen partial suffrage states, and 10.1 hours in
the nineteen non-suffrage states. The maximum day's
work for a child is 8.6 hours in the suffrage states, 9 hours
in the partial suffrage states, and 9.5 hours in the non-suffrage
states, while the ages for prohibited child labor
are 14.3 years, 14.1 years, and 13.3 years, respectively.
In the same order, the ages at which the consent of parent
or guardian is required for marriage of young women
are 18.9 years, 19.3 years, and 19.1 years, respectively,
and the ages at which girls may consent to their own
ruin are 17.5 years, 16.6 years, and 15 years in the three
groups of states.</p>

<p>Now, if populations be considered in these three groups,
instead of political divisions merely, it will be found that
only 5,193,116 people in the suffrage states of California,
Colorado, Idaho, and Kansas are under the law which
fixes the ideal "age of consent" at 18; that 6,229,263
people are under this beneficent law in the non-suffrage
states of Florida, Missouri, and Tennessee, and 17,161,100
people have passed this law in the partial suffrage states
of Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New
York, North Dakota, and Wisconsin; it should be observed,
too, that the women voters in the partial suffrage
states&mdash;less than 5 per cent. of those women vote, by the
way&mdash;have nothing to do with electing the men who
passed this and the other laws discussed by Mrs. DeForest.
Like proportions of population hold with respect to all the
laws passed in the three classes of states; taking the
best law in each case, it may be shown that more people
have it under male suffrage than under equal suffrage.</p>

<p>Thus far this article must seem disappointing to sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
suffragists for it reads like an "anti" document. In the
length and breadth of this Union there are no distinctive
results of woman suffrage where it has been granted in
part or in whole.</p>

<p>But there are abundant results of the feminist movement.
In agitating for the ballot Lucretia Mott and her
fellow and sister suffragists builded better than they
knew. In <i>not</i> following the English method of making
suffrage a paramount issue "first, last, and all the time,"
they and the latter-day suffragists have rapidly brought
to pass the feminist reforms, including the extension of
the suffrage to women. They have not played the shrew
like the English militants, and they are making greater
headway than the militants. In this country the redress
of woman's grievances has come ante hoc and cum hoc&mdash;not
post hoc, and hardly ever propter hoc&mdash;with respect
to woman's suffrage. The cases of California and Washington,
the male-elected legislatures of which gave to
women workers eight-hour laws at the same time they
granted them the suffrage, are fairly typical; "indirect
influence" accomplished both results.</p>

<p>Whether the vote in woman's hands may ultimately be
better utilized; whether she may use it to aid in freeing the
men voters from their thraldom to long ballots and the
bosses, with the result of giving both sexes the direct
influence on their government that they both lack&mdash;that
is a question quite beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<h2>THE BABY AND THE BEE</h2>


<p>The baby lay in her carriage looking up at the over-hanging
soft green leaves and white flowers of a lilac
bush. A light wind came rather chilly from the north,
despite the day of blue sky and flooding sunshine, and
so the carriage had been wheeled a little around a south
corner of the house, and left there. Baby was alone with
her thumbs and fingers, her big wide eyes and the warm
sunshine and her busy little brain. She was a baby of
early mental development. Her parents thought her in
the way to be a genius.</p>

<p>In the white flowers among the soft green leaves of the
lilac bush busy worker bees foraged. They worked actively
in the warm sunshine, some lapping up with long
tongues of marvelous complexity the nectar from the
open flowerets, while others loaded their thighs with the
sticky yellowish pollen. They came and went between
the flowers and their distant hive, each one doing its own
work unaided and unhindered and even apparently unnoticed
by any other.</p>

<p>The baby watched them with big wide eyes, uncomprehending,
for nature study had not yet come into her curriculum.
She liked their activity though, and more than
once put up her tiny hands uncertainly as if to feel or
grasp them.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the bees, with the pollen baskets on
its thighs filled to overflowing, dropped down on to the
knitted afghan that covered the baby's body below the
arms. It staggered about a moment, buzzed its wings
violently without being able to fly, and then resignedly
stood still with legs outspread and wings occasionally
gently vibrating. The baby's eyes, soon tired of staring
up into the too bright sky, turned their attention to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
wriggling thumbs, and, a moment after, discovered the
tired bee. She put out one hand suddenly toward it.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the bee, "but I wouldn't touch me
if I were you."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the baby, "shall I hurt you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I should have to hurt you," answered the bee
gently.</p>

<p>"You? You little thing hurt me? That's rather absurd,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Much littler things than I can hurt much bigger
things than you," said the bee, sententiously. "But,
really, don't you know what I am, and what I can do?"</p>

<p>"No, pardon me for my stupid ignorance, but I do not.
I seem to have seen a picture in one of my father's books
that resembles you; but it was labelled <i>Apis mellifica</i>, and
that told me very little."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, that was me," proudly replied the bee.
"That is what I am called in books. But outdoors here
my name is Bee, Honeybee."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Bee. And my name is Baby. I also
have another name; in fact several other names. But I
rather prefer Baby. It relieves me of much responsibility,
and gives me certain powers that my other names fail to
carry with them. May I ask if you read much?"</p>

<p>"I do not read at all," answered the bee, "I do not
need to," it added. "I know all that I need to know when
I am born."</p>

<p>"You mean that you do not have to study, to study
books, long rows of books, in order to know how to live?"
asked the baby in surprise. "If so then it is no wonder
that my father writes about you as he does; that he says
you are the example for us all; and that you and your
cousins the, er, Formicidae...."</p>

<p>"Oh, the ants, yes. That we are ...?"</p>

<p>"That you are the true successes among all the animals
because your knowledge has led you to establish the perfect
society, and to become the only true communists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
among them all. He says that your life should be the
guide for ours; that when we human beings can thoroughly
adopt your ways we shall have solved all our problems."</p>

<p>"How wonderfully you talk!" interrupted the bee. "I
suppose that comes from reading. You do read a lot, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am making a beginning, yes," answered the
baby with a sigh. "But it is discouraging sometimes.
Here I've only just got through the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>
and now they have turned out a new edition. But
I get a great deal of my knowledge of life from hearing my
father and mother talk; and my nurse, she is a very superior
person, too."</p>

<p>"Your father writes books? He is a literary man,
then?" asked the bee.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not at all. He is a scientific man. He writes
books only because he has such important things to tell
the people."</p>

<p>"And he writes about me and my cousins the ants?
He tells the people that they should live as we do? Well,
that is encouraging. To tell the truth, some of us have
rather envied you humans. We have wanted to be like
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is silly. Anyway, to be like us in our present
stage of evolution."</p>

<p>"In your present stage of, of&mdash;I am afraid I don't
quite understand," said the bee, rubbing one antenna
over its face in a rather bewildered way.</p>

<p>"Oh, like us as we are now. We are in a dreadful way
just now. We used to have a very good conceit of ourselves.
We were even happy. But that was because we
were so ignorant of our true condition. We know better
now, thanks to my father and some other observant and
thoughtful men. They have seen how miserable we are
and they are telling everybody about it. That is necessary,
you know, in order to change it. They are writing
about it in the newspapers, in the magazines, in little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
books, in big books. Our business, our politics, our government,
our society, our religion, our very line of evolution;
all wrong. At the bottom of it all there is one great
trouble; we are too much interested in ourselves as individuals.
We want things for ourselves. We should, of
course, only want things for the people of the future. We
should live for the race, not the individual; just as you do,
you know."</p>

<p>"Why, that's funny! We complain of just the opposite.
We don't see why we shouldn't have some good things
for ourselves, and not do everything all the time for
future bees. Even they won't have a good time for they
will have to work for still more future bees."</p>

<p>"But think of the race; the wonderful race to come!"
burst in the baby.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I suppose. But pardon me, please, I am
a little dizzy with all this. You know I dropped down
here to die; but I have been so much interested in what
you said. However, I am afraid I really must die in a
few minutes; and if I don't seem to be particularly bright
just now you will understand and excuse me, won't you?"
And the bee settled down a little lower on her stiffly outstretched
legs, and vibrated both antennae gently as if
to take a few last smells of the lilac-fragrant air.</p>

<p>"Why, this is terrible! You poor dear bee. Dying!
And you talk of it as if it were nothing! Isn't there something
we can do? I will call somebody. All I have to do
is to scream once, and somebody will come in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't trouble yourself at all. Dying is
of no importance whatever with us, you know. In fact
if I am old enough or worn out enough to be weak I have
no right to wish to live longer, and it would be wrong
for anyone to help me. That is part of our perfect communism,
you know. We only live for each other and for
the race. And if we are weak or sick&mdash;but you know,
of course, from hearing your father explain it."</p>

<p>The baby was silent for a moment. Her big, wide eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
strained even wider now by horror and pity, were fastened
on the bee, while it held its own head up as bravely as it
could to look steadily into the baby's face. The bee and
the baby had someway become friends. Both felt it.
And they were silent together, but understanding each
other, as friends can.</p>

<p>The baby spoke first. "Dear Bee, if I can't do anything
to save you, is there anything I can do"&mdash;and a
tear rolled down into her mouth&mdash;"after?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; you are surprisingly good. Do you really
want to do something? Well, if you could someway
arrange to see that my load of pollen"&mdash;and it moved
its two laden hind legs slightly&mdash;"gets to the hive, it
would be a great favor to me."</p>

<p>"Why, that is dreadful again! You are only thinking
of the others. I mean can't I do something just for you,
alone?"</p>

<p>The bee did not answer. Her hind legs slid down and
out until they were nearly flat on the afghan. Suddenly
the baby's face lighted. And with an extraordinary and
extremely precocious display of energy and precision of
movement&mdash;thus beautifully proving the words of that
lamented philosopher who said that we ordinarily draw
on only about half our resources&mdash;she twisted herself
around so that her hands could reach the bee, and put
them out directly to it.</p>

<p>"Now don't hurt me, the way you said you could," she
whispered, "for I am going to help you." And she lifted
the bee gently in one hand and with the long sharp nail of
the tiny fore finger of the other&mdash;a nail the nurse had
neglected for several days&mdash;she deftly pried the pollen
masses off the bee's legs. Then she gently put it down
again and twisted back into place, smiling happily.</p>

<p>"There," she said, "that will relieve you of the weight
of those horrid great pollen loads. It will help you, I am
sure."</p>

<p>It certainly did help the bee. It stood up much higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
on its legs than before. It even made a few feeble steps
nearer the baby's face. But it did not say anything for
a full minute, and when it did speak its voice betrayed its
very strong feeling. Its antennae quivered, and its wings
lifted and fell spasmodically. It was a much moved bee.</p>

<p>"This is very wonderful; the influence you have over
me, Baby," it said. "I ought, by all our tradition and
knowledge, to have stung you. I ought to sting every
live thing that touches me that doesn't have the nest odor.
And you haven't. But you do have a very pleasing smell,
someway. Is that the odor of goodness?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I suppose it's just the bathed baby odor,"
said the baby. "I had my bath only half an hour ago and
was put out here to go to sleep. Only usually I don't go
to sleep. Sometimes I lie and think, and sometimes I
just lie and feel good."</p>

<p>"And then I shouldn't at all have let you take off my
pollen loads," went on the bee, musingly. "If I should be
found by any bees after I am dead without any pollen
on my legs or nectar in my honey stomach they would
think very badly of me indeed. That is," it added a little
bitterly, "if they should think anything about me at all.
But I can't feel as badly as I ought to, someway. I really
feel a great deal better with those loads off. And I thank
you for being so good to me."</p>

<p>"I feel much better, too," said the baby, with a beautiful
smile and sweet little gurgle. "Better because you
are better, and better because I made you better. I don't
think either my bath or my bottle makes me feel better.
You dear bee, I wish I could always help you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Baby. If I were really going to live
much longer I should always remember your smell, and
come to you if I were in trouble."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried the baby, with her eyes dancing, "then you
have learned something. You didn't know everything
when you were born, after all. I expect it is not too wise
to get all one's knowledge from one's ancestors. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the world changes, and new things come into it, and one
needs to be ready to learn. Now we humans are much
newer things than you bees, and there are new things in
our lives. That's why my father's science, which explains
everything by the old things, has always seemed to me to
leave something out of account. What does your father
think about it?"</p>

<p>The bee lifted its antennae in surprise. Not having
eyelids to open nor eyebrows to lift, a surprised bee can
only lift its antennae.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I don't know what my father thinks.
I don't know my father. I haven't even seen him. Or if
I have seen him with the others in the hive, I haven't
known which one was he. I only know he was one of the
strongest and best flying bees in the hive or he would
never have been able to marry my mother."</p>

<p>The baby, whose eyes had opened very wide as the bee
first began to speak, soon recovered herself, for she remembered
what her father had written in the report of
one of his committees, the Committee on Eugenics, she
thought it was. She had read parts of it one day when the
nurse had left her for an hour in her father's study.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I had forgotten. Only the biggest and
strongest bees can be the fathers of the future bees. And
that's about all your father does, isn't it; just be your
father."</p>

<p>"Yes, we kill them off after mother begins bearing us,"
answered the bee simply.</p>

<p>"Gracious, what a dreadful thing to do!"</p>

<p>"Why, not at all. They are all pretty old then. And
we strong young bees can do the work much better. In
fact they couldn't do the work at all. They would only
be extra mouths to bring food for, and extra bodies to
give space to in the hive. It is far better for the race to
get them out of the way," said the bee.</p>

<p>"But your mother; you know her, don't you? And you
don't kill her, I hope?" said the baby anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I do know her, but she doesn't know me. You
see when one does nothing but bear children, and has
twenty or thirty thousand of them, and more, all very
much alike, she couldn't expect to be much interested in
any one of them, or even to know them apart. She only
bears us; the nurses take care of us from the moment we
are born until we are able to take care of ourselves. We
don't kill our mother, anyway as long as she is vigorous
and not too old, for it is very economical to have a few
carefully selected, tested mothers produce all the children.
But doesn't your father write about all of that in his book
that tells people how to live like us?"</p>

<p>Baby was silent for a little while; then answered thoughtfully.
"Why, yes; I had forgotten for the moment. He
does have most of it in. But I think not that about
killing off the fathers so soon. I'd hate to think of killing
my father. He is such good fun sometimes; besides being
no end of good to me all the time. He is especially good,
I think, because I am not very strong, you know. I
guess I shan't ever be able to walk. It's my back or
something. Nobody tells me much, but I have heard
them talk. And then always father comes and kisses me;
and he cries a little."</p>

<p>The bee looked earnestly up into the baby's face. "It
seems to me," it said after a moment, "that your father
isn't very consistent. If you can never walk, he ought
to kill you now, hadn't he? Excuse me, I didn't mean to
say anything dreadful, but isn't that what the welfare of
your race demands? Only strong well people to live;
especially the women, the mothers of the race?"</p>

<p>The baby had recovered from her start at the bee's
first words, and kept silent, evidently very thoughtful.
Then a slow smile came over her face.</p>

<p>"I guess it's just because my father is a human being
and not a bee or any other lower animal that he isn't
consistent. Excuse me, but you know we have to call
them that from our point of view. We are animals; science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
is right about that. And we do animal things. But there
are so many different animal things. Not all animals
are alike, are they? There are big differences between
you and a starfish, aren't there; or just a stupid polyp that
can only shut up and open like a plant, and eat, and bud
off little polyps and jellyfishes. And probably there are
big differences between a man and, well, even a bee or
an ant. It's the scientific fashion just now to be awfully
economical about explanations. What will explain a polyp
is tried on the bees; and what explains the successful life
of the bees and ants is made to do for human beings. I
sometimes think my father's training is too much for his
head. I know it contradicts his heart. Do you know,
though, he isn't so inconsistent as he seems. For he says
to mother that, weak as I am, I may sometime do more
for the world than the strongest washerwoman that ever
bore ten children. He says," and the baby dropped her
voice to a soft whisper, "that I may write a beautiful
poem or a great book that teaches faith and love, and do
the world a lot of good by it. And mother says that
whether I write it or not, I <i>am</i> a poem of beauty and a
book that teaches love. So I suppose that is why father
is so inconsistent about&mdash;about killing me, you know."</p>

<p>Just then a step sounded from the path around the
corner.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the nurse," cried the baby. "She will
take me in. And she is so stupid; she won't let me have
you in the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, anyway I have to be dying so soon now,"
said the bee, also a little sadly. "I am sorry that I can
never see you again. It has all been so interesting. And
you have taught me some things, and besides, and more
than all, you have been good to me. I&mdash;I think you are
going to be worth while to your race. I think you are
already. You are worth while to all of us; to the whole
world. You have given me ten minutes of happy living.
Could you do just one little thing more for me? Will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
drop me down under the lilac bush, so I can have our
flowers, that we both like so well, over me when I am
dead?" And one antenna rubbed slowly over one of the
bee's eyes, as if this approach to humanness had engendered
the impossible, a bee's tear.</p>

<p>The baby twisted her infirm little body about again,
stretched out her hands, and gently lifted the bee. "Good-bye,
dear Bee," she whispered; "Good-bye, dear Baby,"
answered the bee. Then the baby carried the bee to her
lips, and kissed it.</p>

<p>At that very moment the nurse leaned over the carriage
with an indulgent smile on her face, which changed swiftly
to horrified dismay as she saw the bee at baby's lips. She
cried aloud, while baby with a quick flirt of little hands
lightly tossed the bee under the lilac. As the nurse saw
the tears streaming down the baby's face she believed
her worst fears realized, and catching the child to her
bosom, she ran into the house saying over and over:</p>

<p>"Did a bad bee sting my itty bitty sweetie angel?"
And as she ran she was amazed to hear among the baby's
sobs what sounded like a spoken word repeated again and
again. Baby really seemed to be saying, "<i>No, No, No,
No!</i>"</p>

<h2>THE CASE FOR PIGEON-HOLES</h2>


<p>The gigantic desk at which the Essayist was seated
displayed row on row of pigeon-holes, and above
them all was a big white card, on which appeared, in
distinct black letters:</p>

<p class="center">Saturday, January 31, 1914</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="day schedule">
<tr><td align="right">7.30 a. m.</td><td align="left">.....</td><td align="right">12.30 p. m.</td><td align="left">.........</td><td align="left">Pigeon-holes</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">12.30 p. m.</td><td align="left">.....</td><td align="right">3.00 p. m.</td><td align="left">.........</td><td align="left">Miscellany</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">3.00 p. m.</td><td align="left">.....</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>but the rest of the day need not concern us.</p>

<p>The Essayist had been reared in a stronghold of Method&mdash;a
home where the dishes were never left over and the
tools were always returned to their places, where the children
always went to Sunday School and never stopped
to think that they didn't enjoy it, and their elders always
went to prayer-meeting and never missed church&mdash;in
a word, where everybody was always doing everything
never and always, and nobody ever doing anything sometimes.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that the Madness of Method
followed, or rather pursued, him all his days, and his existence
was filled with devices for the facilitation of the
business of life. The big desk was one of these devices.
It had a hundred and twenty pigeon-holes, and their
labelling, especially in the rows that were to receive classified
ideas, was a triumph of invention. He had had
trouble with ideas. They got wrongly assorted, or lost,
got away over night, flew at him in parabolic curves and
never came back, or flitted about his head and would not
submit to scrutiny, and otherwise flouted him. He would
have no more of it.</p>

<p>Just now he was contemplating with a glow of satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
not only his own particular pigeon-holes, but Pigeon-holes
Universal. Blessings on the soul of that primitive
man, the first really deserving to be called ancestor of the
human race, who noticed that some things were like
other things&mdash;that the world about him was not a mere
agglomeration of endless individual objects and phenomena!
What an impulse to the setting in order of the
world's business, for example, and what relief to himself,
when the Lucretian father of astronomy and history
settled to the satisfaction of himself and his hairy fellows
that the same sun they saw sink behind the hills at night
would appear again next morning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the sun and light of day had gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wailings loud they did not roam the fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying for it among the shades of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quiet lay, in slumber sepulchred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the sun, with rosy torch, should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring his light into the heaven again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hence the pigeon-holing of day and night, of moon and
stars, of seasons and years, "seed-time and harvest, heat
and hoary frost," of all the possibilities of life and achievement.
Incomparable benefaction!</p>

<p>And what ineffable relief&mdash;his thoughts ran on&mdash;when
men began to realize that some human beings were like
others not only in form, but in feeling; that it was not
necessary to scan each individual act of your neighbor in
order to form a basis for each of your own acts, but that
some details of conduct were <i>semper</i>, <i>ubique</i>, <i>ab omnibus</i>!
What a gain to be able to classify men into friends and
enemies, to set apart by themselves the common good and
the common bane, to be aware of correspondences of
action and emotion, to judge of the future by the past!
What an advance on the high road leading to stability of
expectation and all its fruitful consequences!</p>

<p>And when men began to apply the principle of pigeon-holing
to the actual business of life, what economy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
time and of energy! Civilization itself, with its multitudinous
associations of human beings in common effort,
was a big desk with pigeon-holes. Man had <i>noticed</i>, and
was fast approaching the peak of perfection, while the
races of wild, wide-wandering beasts, ignorant both of
the blessings and of the very conception of pigeon-holing,
still lived their hard and coarse existence among the
acorn-bearing groves,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of common welfare had no thought, nor knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The use of law and custom among men.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With all its intelligence, effort, and boldness, what
would the human race not achieve! What had it not
achieved already! The Essayist's enthusiasm was kindled
as he thought of the past and present wonders of
classification and organization&mdash;of races, nations, parties,
unions, communities, families; of the marvels of
social, educational, political, industrial, and military
coöperation; of the religions and philosophies of history;
of classified and recorded knowledge. He thought of the
arts, sciences, law, and the crafts, with everything about
them all printed in books and deposited in libraries, where
anyone might read and learn. What high and rapid
building, what numerous and rushing trains, what capacious
liners and freighters, what ease and quickness of
communication, what mingling of nations, what universalization
of ideas! What wise use of means, and what
efficiency! In education alone, scores of thousands of
children in his own land, large and small, rich and poor,
various in blood, quality, and color, were at that moment
being instructed by common methods with common
money in common ideas and ideals&mdash;the homogeneous
fine flour of American citizenship ground in one great
mill of omnicapacious hopper.</p>

<p>He looked next into the future, and there saw glorious
visions. For pigeon-holing was not only progress, but
cumulative progress. The greatest of its many virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
was that the more it was perfected, the more time there
was to make it still more perfect. Pigeon-holing begat
organization; organization begat leisure; leisure begat
contemplation; contemplation begat wisdom; wisdom
begat action; action begat progress; progress meant advance
in civilization; and civilization meant more and
better pigeon-holing. The chain was endless.</p>

<p>Yes, pigeon-holing meant cumulative progress, and the
cumulative process had never been so rapid, nor given
so much promise, as just now. The world had never
before possessed so many appliances to facilitate the
pigeon-holing of men and things and movements. There
had always been enormous losses in efficiency. Now,
however, nothing was being lost or wasted, as in the days
when System had been a less jealous goddess; now, everything
which men found out was being accurately recorded
or neatly tied up, or carefully deposited, or put into the
general circulation of life universal, or otherwise conserved.</p>

<p>And not only was everything conserved, but production
itself, thanks to pigeon-holing, was far more rapid now
than ever before. The march of civilization was quickening
to double time. Pigeon-holing and Efficiency were
the two great features of the age, and walked, or rather
rushed, hand in hand. The more pigeon-holing, the more
efficiency; the more efficiency, the more time saved; the
more time saved, the more pigeon-holes; and so on, with
ever increasing momentum, <i>in saecula saeculorum amen</i>.
From the labor unions that maintained walking delegates
and boycotts, to the great trusts that were responsible for
high-priced beef and long-packed eggs and pure-food
inspectors, everyone was working with the greatest possible
speed and efficiency, and everything was being
pigeon-holed to the utmost perfection. It was the age of
time-tables and interest-tables, cash registers, and adding
machines; steam shovels, steam seeders, harvesters, and
threshers; cyclometers, pedometers, and taxicabs; type-writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
and linotyping and photography; telephones and
automobiles and book reviews; technical schools and
teachers' courses, education by correspondence, books on
etiquette and how-to-enjoy-the-arts, piano-players and
phonographs; library cataloguers, Who's Whos, encyclopedias,
and blanks-to-be-filled-out-and-returned-at-once;
world languages, one-class steamers, democracy, cosmopolitanism,
and peace conferences; tinned foods, department
stores, and women's clubs; reference Bibles, dictionaries
of handy quotations, hints on diet, menus for
the month, short cuts to culture, wireless telegraphy, big
guns and big business, joy riding, air-ships, simplified
spellings, and a universal A.B. degree.</p>

<p>Let us not be surprised if the Essayist grew a trifle
delirious. Progress is a thing of enthusiasm, and its devotees
are easily wrought upon by the frenzy of the god.</p>

<p>What was to be the glorious goal of this cumulative
progress? The Essayist's thoughts took on aërial daring.
In the realm of knowledge, for example&mdash;what an inspiring
vision! He had often thought of the pity of it&mdash;that
scholars through the ages had consumed their lives
in effort that was largely in vain: laboriously amassing the
knowledge possessed by their predecessors, only to die
and leave it as scant as when they had received it.</p>

<p>But that was in the olden time. Now, with the art of
printing democratized, with specialization firmly established,
with all the wonderful book-keeping and card-cataloguing
that characterized intellectual activities, with
the willingness of scholars to study and record <i>everything</i>,
and of libraries to purchase and preserve <i>everything</i>, for
fear of losing <i>anything</i>, with all the learning of the past
immediately at hand, and with all the means and appliances
available for its rapid utilization, why might
scholarship not aspire to reach the absolute heights of
knowledge? Might it not be possible now for the scholar
to receive the torch of learning fully ablaze, and to run
the race that was set before him without the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
stopping to renew or even trim it&mdash;for him to make, so
to speak, more effective dashes at the pole of learning&mdash;or
to build to the very heaven the intellectual Tower of
Babel, whose downfall would not be so easily possible
now as in an age when men had not been alive to the
need of linguistic pigeon-holes?</p>

<p>But intellect was not the greatest thing in the world.
Might not the ever increasing skill in pigeon-holing lead
before long to a definition of religion, the cessation of
doctrinal quarrels, and the sinking of all differences in a
common ideal of administration, conduct, and even belief?
Yes; might it not lead to the final obliteration of
national and racial, and even social, distinctions? Might
it not lead, and at no distant date, not only to democracy
and social equality, but to universal democracy&mdash;when
the war-drum throbbed no longer, etc.?</p>

<p>Having thus in imagination surveyed the glories of
pigeon-holing, the Essayist seized upon his pen, and
rapidly set his thoughts to paper, not omitting to make
liberal use of the pigeon-holes before him whenever he
adumbrated quotations with which he thought his page
might be embellished.</p>

<p>The task finished, he glanced at the clock. The forenoon
was only half spent. Looking over his sheets, too,
he observed that his essay was only half the length an
intelligent and good-natured reader ought to endure.</p>

<p>This was just as he would have it, for he had begun with
the definite intention of appearing both for and against
pigeon-holes. There was time enough left to make his
work symmetrical by presenting the other side, and to
append a conveniently stated conclusion. He knew from
the editors that readers in general disliked nothing quite
so much as being left to make up their own minds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So he took up the pen again.</p>

<p>What! After all that rhapsodizing, not a believer in
pigeon-holes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so bad as that. He was a believer, but not a blind
believer. The fact is, he had a lively sense of the limitations
of pigeon-holing. He had arrived at familiarity
with both its virtues and its defects through personal experience.
He had dealt in pigeon-holes himself, had made
them, used them, and had been in them, and for years
had been growing more and more conscious that the use
of them was a difficult and delicate matter.</p>

<p>Earlier in life, it had not been so. He still remembered
vividly the time when all men were easily classifiable&mdash;into
good and bad, Christian and heathen, saved and unsaved,
rich and poor, wise and foolish, as easily as into
black and white, or fat and lean; when all nations except
the United States, and all governments except democracy,
were inferior. He remembered the surprise with which
he had heard for the first time that there was a difference
between prohibition and temperance, that there were many
forms of intemperance besides drunkenness, that English
government had many points of superiority over American.
He had always supposed that with those questions it
was as with slavery in the mind of Charles Sumner:
"Gentlemen, to this slavery question there can be no other
side."</p>

<p>He also recalled the ferment started in his mind by a
much respected teacher's remark that all truth was relative,
not absolute: whether a man was good depended on
what you meant by goodness; whether two and two made
four depended on whether one and one made two; grammar
and spelling were after all only fashions, and things
that appeared in print might not be true; not even the
dictionary was absolute, and the Bible was not inspired
in every letter and punctuation mark.</p>

<p>All this shook the ground under his feet, and it took
some time to recover. That about the Bible and the dictionary
was especially confounding. He reeled to and
fro, and staggered like a drunken man, and was at his
wit's end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>You will call him stupid. He was. Most pigeon-holers
are, to tell the truth. He was like them in being
so busy with virtuous action that he found but little time
for thought. He used the pigeon-holes customary in his
neighborhood, without questioning the correctness of
content or label.</p>

<p>But in time he came to realize that there was religion
outside of sects and that there were many believers who
were unconscious unbelievers, that men might be honest
and still dishonorable, that a great deal of the most pernicious
lying in the world was done without the utterance
of a syllable, that the guiltless were often criminal and the
criminal guiltless, that many democrats were really aristocrats,
many fools really wise, many a rich man poor and
many a poor man rich, many a learned man ignorant,
many pessimists really optimists, and many optimists
really stumbling-blocks to progress.</p>

<p>By the Saturday morning on which we catch sight of
him, he had come to have a wholesome distrust of the
pigeon-holes of others; and whenever he took a specimen
from his own, he submitted it to fresh examination, tolerating
pigeon-holes at all only under perpetual protest
against men's careless use of them.</p>

<p>For there were multitudinous differences between things
to all appearances absolutely alike. It was impossible
to classify even the inanimate without some sort of violence.
Even the products of the die and the press showed
variation, however infinitesimal; and as for Nature, in
her realm there were no two things alike. Plants, animals,
persons, mountains, valleys, and streams&mdash;unending
variety was the rule. The two faces most alike in all the
world proved widely different on close examination, and
the points of difference between the persons who owned
them were infinite.</p>

<p>And not only that. Not only <i>were</i> all individual things
really different from all other things, but each individual
thing <i>seemed</i> different to different persons. Pigeon-holing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
implied pigeon-holers, and no two pigeon-holers were
alike. Like the artists in Plato, they saw the same thing
from different angles: "I mean, that you may look at a
bed from different points of view, obliquely or directly,
or from any other point of view, and the bed will appear
different, but there is no difference in reality." The same
man appeared better or worse, according to the standards
of his judge; the same rain was good or bad, according to
the health or the purpose of the person under the umbrella.
One man's meat was another man's poison. No
two men ever formulated the same definition of a thing,
let alone an abstraction; and if definitions agreed in words,
the words themselves meant different things to their
authors. The Essayist thought of the desperate pass of
Philosophy, patiently waiting while her disciples fruitlessly
endeavored to define each other's definitions. Lucky
for life that living did not hang on wisdom of that sort!</p>

<p>Yes, more than that; no thing&mdash;at least, no living
thing&mdash;had ever been seen twice in exactly the same
aspect by the same person. Not only did the object
change from second to second, under the outward impulse
of sun and wind and rain and the inner impulse of expanding
cell, but the beholder himself was absolutely identical
at no two moments. He might change his physical position,
or be subject to any of the thousand mutations that
sweep over the human spirit like waves of shadow over the
wheat. Everything was in the state of flux. Becoming,
not Being, was the order of all things. And more, each
reacted not only upon its fellow, but upon everything
else. The shifting of an atom affected every other atom
in the universe. Withdraw a drop of water from the ocean,
and there was immediate readjustment of all the waters
that covered the earth. Withdraw a member from human
society, or change him by ever so little&mdash;in health, so
that he ate more; in stature, so that he wore more; in
morals, so that he acted differently&mdash;and the whole
fabric suffered modification. Nothing could be lost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
nothing changed, without impairing in some sort the
universal order. Nothing could be duplicated.</p>

<p>And so in the world of ideas. There was no item of
truth not connected with and dependent upon all other
truth. Let an individual idea in the ocean of a man's
ideas suffer modification, and there was instant readjustment
of all his other ideas, and of his emotions, and of
his actions; and, under their impulse, of the actions, emotions,
and ideas of all other individuals. Truth was one
great, unified whole, never yet beheld, save in partial
vision, by the human mind. To know one item in all its
connections was to possess all knowledge. For the botanist
who knew completely the flower, the mystery of the
universe was solved.</p>

<p>What folly, then, to look for perfect pigeon-holing, when
no two atoms could be found alike, to say nothing of the
motions of the human spirit,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swift as a shadow, short as any dream.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And what injustice and cruelty might it be guilty of, did
its devotees become too rapt in their enthusiasm!</p>

<p>What injustice had they not been guilty of, in the past!
What violence done to nature and to man! What forcings
together and what tearings asunder! What attenuations
and amputations on Procrustean beds! What heart-burnings
they had caused, what hatred and what strife!
What wars on sea and land, what slaughter, what laying
waste, what famine, disease, and hardship, what bereavement,
what languishings in prison, what falling of men
from high estates, what oppression, what rackings and
twistings and manglings of limbs, what persecutions and
executions and excommunications and banishments, what
sunderings of nations and communities, what separations
of persons really congenial who would have been friends
if left to themselves, what disorders&mdash;all sprung from
men's desire to force their fellows into their own social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
and religious pigeon-holes! And ideas&mdash;what struggling
and bleeding and screaming of <i>them</i> at being forced by
brutal hands into narrow and stifling cells with other
ideas in mutual hot resentment. History was filled with
the heartless compulsion of men and things and ideas into
groups where they rebelled against going.</p>

<p>Nor were persecutions and strife confined to the past.
The injustices of pigeon-holing were rampant in the Essayist's
own enlightened time. The old-time sets of pigeon-holes
might no longer be used to such deadly purpose,
but there were others that bade fair to take their place.
The pigeon-holes of religion were less insisted on, but the
pigeon-holes of science gave promise of another tyranny
hardly less unendurable. The two prime factors in tyranny&mdash;arrogant
authority and superstitious multitude&mdash;were
already clearly to be seen. The tyranny of aristocratic
pigeon-holing seemed past, but its place was being
taken by the hardly less outrageous tyranny of democracy's
pigeon-holes. In a world that boasted of producing
the greatest equality known to human kind, there were
more classifiers and more class feeling than men had ever
known before. The pigeon-holes were different, but they
were there, and their partitions as impenetrable as ever.</p>

<p>The very consciousness that they <i>were</i> in different compartments
kept men from attempting to understand each
other, let alone their real differences; more, it made them
hostile, and even aggressive. What philosopher, from
Thales to the latest enemy of Pragmatism, what dogmatist,
from the Stoic to the latest ridiculer of Christian
Science, what political critic, from Aristophanes to the
anarchist of yesterday, ever tried or was willing to understand
his opponent, and did not wilfully misrepresent in
order to confute him? Longfellow was right when he
said that the South should come to see the North, the
North go to see the South, and then the war would be
over. Let men forsake their pigeon-holes and meet face
to face, and many a problem of religion, philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
sociology, industry, and pedagogy would cease to be a
problem&mdash;and many an official and professorial chair
would be vacant.</p>

<p>But for the most part, either from their own impulse
or from compulsion, men remained in their pigeon-holes.
Many a man who had voluntarily emerged found his
fellows unwilling to stir to meet him, or even take note of
his having come forth. Many a man could not get out, if
he would, and spent his life beating against the partitions,
clamoring loudly and unheeded for redistribution on the
ground of a thousand facts.</p>

<p>In vain! The malefactor and the magdalen could be
rescued from their pigeon-holes only by a miracle, were
they ever so repentant and filled with good works. The
world had disposed of them, ceased to consider them,
forgotten them&mdash;even though it was a loser as well as
a tyrant. What service had been lost to the State by the
pigeon-holing of party&mdash;talent and patriotism denied a
sphere of usefulness because of being among the minority!
What willing hearts lost to religion because of the pigeon-holes
of creed and denomination! And there were men
who were misjudged and abused all their lives long, living
sacrifices to some accident of pigeon-holing, and to the
neglect which was its usual consequence. Give a dog a
bad name, and hang him.</p>

<p>Away with pigeon-holing then, as violent, tyrannical,
and oppressive, a foe to individuality of men and ideas,
and an obstacle to real progress! Away with curbs and
yardsticks and tapes and molds and stamps and presses
and dies, and all manner of interference with nature and
her methods of expansion! Let nature, and especially
human nature, realize itself, like any plant or flower!
Fired by imagination, the Essayist started up, glowering
at his desk and thinking of the axe. He had not yet
attained, you see, to the full measure of Scientific Calm,
and was in a fair way to usurp the functions of judge,
jury, and sheriff, as well as attorney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>But he sat back again, and reflected. No pigeon-holes
at all? What heresy, thus to fly in the face of his own
practice, and of evolution! Imagine it&mdash;for men to eat
only when hungry, to plan a costume for every dinner out,
to have no office hours and no fixed prices, no churches
and no schools, no coined money, no uniforms in parades,
and no parades, no laws to regulate conduct in the large,
no street numbers, no marks by which to detect a book
agent or a mine promoter before answering the door-bell,
no catalogues, no voting-machines, no diplomas, no marriage-bond,
no social and religious ties at all! Why, what
was that but anarchy?</p>

<p>Of course it was anarchy, and the Essayist knew it all
the time. You must remember that he had set out to
present both sides of the case. If he was a bit carried
away by his own pleading, that is not a bad fault in the
advocate.</p>

<p>And now he was ready to assume also the role of judge,
and to charge the jury&mdash;by which I mean, of course, the
readers of <span class="smcap">The Unpopular</span>.</p>

<p>Being a Horatian, he summed up in favor of the Golden
Mean, and recommended pigeon-holing to the favorable
consideration of the jury. It had its proper use, and it
had its misuse. There was harmless pigeon-holing, where
you reduced to order dead and material things, or classified
living entities on the basis of essentials. So long as
you did no great violence, and were ready to entertain
motions for reconsideration, it was desirable for the sake
of economy in time and energy to use pigeon-holes, even
at some cost. In other words, if you were to enjoy the
benefits of civilization, or, indeed, to possess it at all, you
must introduce into the anarchy of perfect individualism
a greater or less degree of the artificiality of collectivism.</p>

<p>But there was a limit beyond which neither individual
man nor society in the aggregate should go.</p>

<p>A limit, Your Honor? And pray, who was to establish
the limit? That was not so easy. Clearly, no man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
establish the limit for another man. Each man must
determine for himself; and society must determine for
<i>its</i> self, by means of that most mysterious of all consciousnesses,
the universal consciousness.</p>

<p>In other words, pigeon-holing was the creation of no
rule; it was an Art. The masterpiece was an individual
product, a resolution of many forces. And civilization,
so closely dependent upon pigeon-holing, was an Art,
not a science&mdash;no, not even a social science. Let those
who looked to save society by invention and application
of rules alone consider well their ways. No anarchist was
farther removed than they from the truth that should
make men free.</p>

<p>In still other words, it was the Golden Mean which
society, as well as the individual, should strive for. And
this was no easy Panacea. The Golden Mean meant
struggle&mdash;a struggle constant and eternal&mdash;to maintain
an equilibrium. You had to watch unceasingly your
balances, and to shift and reshift your weights&mdash;without
intermittence, and forever. The devotion called for was
so great that it took the inspiration of religious ideals to
insure it. Human society was a Gothic cathedral&mdash;a
unified and beautiful structure, but one whose complex
members exerted everlasting pressure each on each, and
must not long be left to themselves. To measure, and
hew, and build, was not all. The pile could not be
finished at once and forever. Let the architect relax his
watchfulness, and decaying members soon would spoil
the symmetry of the noble lines, or even precipitate the
whole in awful ruin.</p>

<p>And here was where lay most of the trouble with pigeon-holing,
past and present. Man was lazy. It was not
wholly the enlightened desire for progress which had
inspired him to pigeon-holing, and was continuing to
inspire. Dislike of work, and selfishness, and vanity, all
played a part as well, and not a small one.</p>

<p>It was so reposeful to dispose of things in the large&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
educate by the hundred thousand, to rest in the arms of
creed, to stand at the lever of a great machine, to have
your tailor plan your suits and the cook or the newspaper
your meals, to have a dozen pigeon-holes into which you
conveniently popped new acquaintances and had them
off your mind forever. It was so much easier to force
men to accept your own beliefs and plans than to take
the trouble to acquaint yourself with theirs. It was so
much more satisfying and final to follow mere logic and
go to the end of the process than always to be engaged in
that most laborious of tasks&mdash;thinking and forming
judgments. To write a volume embodying all the facts
was much easier than to write an essay presenting the
essentials and their interpretation. A perfectly democratic
or a perfectly absolute government was far less
difficult to plan than the ideal commonwealth. It was
much easier to act on insufficient premises than to travail
with thought and find that after all there was no ground
for action. It was easier to be an ignoramus or a pedant
than a real scholar, a dogmatist or an atheist than a good
preacher, a lecturer on education than a teacher, a slouch
or a dandy than a well dressed man, a persecutor or a
humanitarian than a saver of souls, a despot or an anarchist
than a shepherd of the people, a censor or an abettor
than a monitor and adviser, a total abstainer or a drunkard
than a temperate man, a conservative or a radical than
a patriot, a boor or a fop than a gentleman. It was easier
to be a beast, or not to be at all, than to be a MAN.</p>

<p>The Essayist looked at the clock. It was twelve-thirty.
Once more he had successfully pigeon-holed the hours of
his morning.</p>

<h2>THE GREEKS ON RELIGION AND MORALS</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>If any lesson can be learned from history, which
historians tell us is not the case, it would seem to
be that what we call "goodness" is on the whole ineradicable.
By goodness the race survives. Every one of us,
struggle as he may, is constrained in his degree to be less
bad than he might be. Many of us confess freely that we
do not know why this is so. We do not know whether
there is a moral law. If there is a moral law, we do not
know whether its origin is transcendental and arbitrary,
biological and definitely ascertainable, or social and fluctuating.
Moreover we do not so much as know whether
we are free agents, choosing continually between good and
evil, or automata, feeling, to be sure, the stress of conflicting
forces, but bound mathematically to follow the line
of their compromise. We are of course comfortably able
to ignore all these considerations in our everyday trains
of thought. Just as the schoolboy learns to say parrotwise
that the sun sits still and swings us round, though he
sees him every evening descend to rest in New Jersey like
a tired commuter; and just as the uncompromising idealist
behaves exactly like the man who believes in the knowable
reality of the world; so the most convinced determinist
must act from morning to night as though he were
a free agent, and must judge his fellowmen as though
they too were choosers. Moreover almost all of us adopt
instinctively some concrete reason for the choices we
assume we are making. These reasons being inevitably
partial and ludicrously incommensurate with the cosmic
results that we hang upon them, are constantly in process
of giving way under the strain. The so-called "religious"
reasons land us in the position of having to give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
immoral basis for morality. Either they involve the doctrine
of a future life, and so vitiate the moral impulse with
egoism at its source, or, with a diminished confidence in
the sureness of reward, which is all to the good, they tend
to perpetuate affirmations that have lost their meaning,
which is all to the bad. It seems to have been on the whole
a misfortune that religion and morality, which historically
and logically have neither more nor less to do with each
other than marriage and love, should have become profoundly
associated in Europe in the last two thousand
years. The most pressing duty of the moralist&mdash;and
every man is a moralist&mdash;is to dissolve the merger, and
there are circumstances connected with its origin which
may lessen our estimate of the inconvenience involved
in the dissolution. The mythology, cult, doctrine, exegesis
and ethics of Christianity are considerably more
Greek than Hebraic in origin, and the Greeks in their
prime had excellent ways of their own of dealing with all
these matters. They managed to be profoundly religious
while avoiding the two pits into which the Hebrews fell,
first, the confounding of myth with history, and, second,
the erection of morals on a supernatural, jural and egoistic
basis. Let us then consider the Greeks.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The most remarkable fact in connection with the religion
of the Greeks is its attitude towards the use of the
reason. Of all the religions known to us this exercised
the least restrictive power over the minds of those who
entertained it. Over their conduct in matters of ritual
it did of course exercise power both restrictive and positive,
but the reason it left free. Greek religion is therefore
recalcitrant to M. Reinach's definition of religion in general
as "a sum of scruples which impede the free exercise
of our faculties." All that was obligatory was ritual;
there was no confession of faith, the priests did not form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
class with vested interests to maintain. The absence of
dogma from a religion will not recommend it to everybody,
but those who regard that as a fortunate circumstance
will grant that the credit rests not with the religion
itself but with the people who hold it. Just as any state
can have as many paupers as it cares to pay for, so any
body of religionists can have as many dogmas as it chooses
to encourage. Greek religion began like any other with
its terrors, its taboos and its magic. If it did not tie up
its adherents hand and foot, as other primitive religions
have done, that was due to the psychological idiosyncracy
of the Greeks. When their time of expansion was over
they became the patients and the agents of dogma, but
in connection with a foreign religion. It might have been
expected from the history of native religions in Greece,
that the strong influence of Greek thought on early Christianity
would have been anti-dogmatic. On the contrary,
practically the whole dogmatic structure of the fathers,
though Oriental in spirit, is Greek in form. The tradition
of free thought could not stand before St. Paul, and
Greek religion, which for fifteen hundred years had given
the world a lesson in the true function and status of
mythology, lent itself in its decay to the creation of a system
which, in the hands of races of very different temperament,
became dogma. But though Greek religion
began with magic and ended with dogma, it very early
rendered the one harmless, and never submitted to the
other in connection with a native cult.</p>

<p>For the primitive Greek, as for the primitive Hebrew,
the Latin, the Maori, the Melanesian, the American
Indian, the world was full of a mysterious force, unaccountable,
able either to curse or to bless; and man's very
existence depended on his ability to learn the laws of this
power's action, to direct it if possible, and if not, to placate
it. As man proceeds along the well-worn path to
animism, the force comes to be thought of as wielded by
will and intelligence like his own. But he never leaves it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
behind him. After the gods are born, he worships them
in terms of it. From his earliest ritualistic act, to the contemporary
sacrament of the Christian church, holy water
for instance has been the means of salvation. For unnumbered
ages ritual has remained unchanged, but its
psychology has changed. What is everywhere performed
today with hope, originated everywhere in the dark past
with fear.</p>

<p>The Eleusinian mysteries sprang doubtless from as
primitive beginnings as any Greek ritual of which we have
knowledge. Nevertheless they are free from many of the
marks of primitive ritual. They show no cannibalism,
probably no totemism, certainly no orgiastic excesses.
If animal sacrifice was practised in the precincts, no blood
was spilt in the hall of the mysteries. Moreover there
was originally nothing either mystic or mysterious about
them, in our sense. But a god came to be associated with
them, a newcomer to Greece, who brought mystery and
mysticism in his train, a god whose mission was to emotionalize
religion. Dionysus, of Thracian origin, was, to
begin with, a vegetation-power, the son of the earth-goddess.
The vine with its strange psychic powers became
the plant oftenest associated with him, but the plane
and the pine were also his, and if he was Dionysus-the-Grape
at Philippi, he was Dionysus-the-Ivy at Acharnania.
Remnants of strong magic, compelling the earth to fertility,
were present in his rites. Like other vegetation-powers
he had a dark side; he suffered death and resurrection,
and was powerful in the world of the dead. In the
history of culture the ritual of Dionysus has a distinguished
place as the putative father of tragedy. In the
history of religion that ritual is chiefly remarkable for
having brought into Greece, together with all the phenomena
of auto-suggestion, a conception that was to have a
portentous sequel, the conception of a sacramental meal
consisting of the body and blood of the god himself, by
partaking of which the communicant shared the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
nature. The whole aim of the Dionysiac method in its
native Thrace was hypnosis; the wild Bacchic dance, the
tossing of the head, the frantic clash of the tambourine,
the harrowing cry of wind-instruments, the waving of
torches in the night, the use of stimulants or narcotics,
and finally the rending and devouring of the still quivering
flesh of the animal which incarnated the god, were all
means of so altering the psychic states of the participant
that he was no longer conscious of the operation of his
own will, but was filled with the god,&mdash;enthusiastic. The
practical aim of the induced ecstasy was doubtless originally
the acquisition of divine power for magical purposes.
As the savage eats his brave enemy to acquire his
bravery, so the early agrarian eats the vegetation-god to
acquire his power of making things grow. But in classical
times the phenomena of enthusiasm had taken on a significance
that overshadowed the claims of vegetation-magic.
Among a people temperamentally self-restrained,
nothing is more curious than the psychology of self-abandonment.
If we must select one aspect of the godhead
as most expressive of the Greek mind, that aspect will
unquestionably be Apollo, lucid, rational, self-possessed
and civilized. The gulf between the two doctrines, between
Apollo's "never too much" and Dionysus' exhortation
to let yourself go, would have constituted heresy
and schism in a dogmatic age.</p>

<p>But the Greek, seeing how true and how indispensable
both are, made shift to bridge the gulf by the set of opinions
associated with the name of Orpheus. The state
of our knowledge of the origins of Orphism may be illustrated
by the fact that Maass says Orpheus was a god and
indigenous in Greece, Miss Harrison believes him to have
been a man, probably a native of Crete whence he made
his way to Greece by way of Thrace, while Reinach declares
he was a fox-totem of the Bassarids. Fortunately
it does not greatly matter. What is really important,
not only for Hellenism but for Christianity, is the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
of his doctrine, of which we can recover, not it is true,
anything like expository teaching, but the traces of the
color it laid on almost every fabric of Greek thought.
No image could more justly picture it than the faded
remnants of paint found on the remains of Greek buildings
and sculptures. It is pretty nearly impossible to our
imagination to tolerate the vision of a temple or a statue
clad otherwise than in its original whiteness or in the beautiful
tones bestowed by time and rust. And similarly the
forms of Greek spiritual expression show to the soul's eye
as logical, pure and monotone. But just as surely as the
houses of the gods were painted gaudily with red and
blue and green, as surely as their hair was ruddy and their
cheeks glowing, so surely was their worship touched and
tinted with the emotion that transcends and defies reason.</p>

<p>Orphism took up and developed the mystic elements of
the Dionysiac cult, giving them a higher spiritual content
and a more restrained expression. It was a scheme of
salvation, based on the hope of life after death. The
central fact of religious experience was communion with
the god; by eating his body and drinking his blood the
worshipper partook of his nature, of which immortality
was an attribute. "To become Bacchus" was the aim
of the partaker of the sacrament. But whereas the old
Thracian ritual surrendered the worshipper to the god by
means of drunkenness and frenzy, the new ritual induced
ecstasy by the equally efficacious use of fasting, silence
and quiet suggestion. Orphism though of foreign origin
became a genuine Greek religion, and was the last. It
was never adopted by the state, but remained in the
hands of private congregations. Through these it permeated
Greece. Thinkers and poets and the plain people
were reached by its different methods of appeal. If we
sum up its most striking characteristics, we cannot fail to
see how strong was its influence on the world-religion
that was to succeed it. Orphism took up the beliefs of
paganism, and adapted them to its own ends. It gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
them fresh life through its doctrine of the immortality of
the soul. It taught that the soul after death rests for a
time in a state of probation, and is finally, according to
the works done in the body, either admitted to felicity or
punished by reincarnation. Final felicity was to be obtained
by ceremonial purity of life, reached through the
use of sacraments necessary to salvation, and the chief
of these sacraments was the symbolic and memorial partaking
of the body and blood of a god slain by his enemies.
By the proper use of sacraments, the living could improve
the condition of the dead; unscrupulous priests sometimes
traded on the simplicity of ignorant worshippers, and
engaged for money to perform rites that should free the
transgressor from the consequences of his transgression,
whether he were alive or dead. The cult of Orpheus
therefore summarizes an enormous range of human history.
From the Mountain Mother of the Cretan seals
and her son, through the patriarchal reign of Zeus, to
Mary and the son of Mary, it follows certain apparently
unchanging requirements of the soul.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the Eleusinia was a magnificent pageant,
the culmination of the religious year. It was a
strong appeal to eye and ear, and to the <i>psychologie de la
foule</i>. It was probably accompanied neither by dogmatic
exhortation nor by any appeal to the intellect. Aristotle
analyzed the method in a sentence: "The initiated do not
learn anything; rather they feel certain emotions, and are
put into a certain frame of mind." This frame of mind
was a hopeful one for this life and the next. On the
supernatural side, the mystic felt that he was sure of the
good-will of the great powers of the underworld, having
done them honor, eaten of their food and enrolled himself
as their friend and follower. On the natural side, he had
felt the benefit&mdash;on which all ritual is based&mdash;of performing,
in unison with others, after preparation both
bodily and mental, and with the moving accompaniments
of beautiful and impressive sights and sounds, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
acts entirely apart from the ordinary routine of life, and
venerable with the usage of the past. But it is to be
noted that although the door was open for communication
between religion and morals, the original conception
of purity was formal and ceremonial, a survival of magic.
We may picture Greek morals as standing with one foot
on a religious, the other on a social basis; but if, as in the
usual posture of Greek sculpture, the weight of the body
is thrown chiefly on one foot, that is the social one. When
foreign cults began to make their way into Greece, they
generally followed the form of the mystery. Isis, Serapis
and Mithras, oriental in origin but Hellenized in ritual,
were centers for religions of the personal, mystic and consolatory
type. All these oriental cults brought with them
a tendency to take literally what the Greeks had taken
loosely, and Mithraism brought a high development of
the tendency to base morality on the egoistic motive.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the wide prevalence of these and similar
rites on the shores of the Mediterranean during the first
century of our era, we are in a position to understand a
situation which Archdeacon Cheetham and Dr. Hatch
discussed fifteen years ago. In apostolic times the Christian
sacraments were of the most informal character
possible. A man could be baptized at any time in any
place by anyone. "Lo, here is water; what hindereth me
to be baptized?" For the years immediately succeeding
the apostolic, we have no evidence, and by the time evidence
begins again, a great change is visible. Baptism
no longer follows at once on conversion, but is preceded
by a probationary term, as was initiation. It can no
longer be performed anywhere at any time, but only in
the great churches and at one of the great festivals, generally
Easter-even or Pentecost. Similarly, once in the year,
on the 16th of Boedromion, the candidates for initiation
used to go down to the sea in a body to be purified by
immersion. And baptism is no longer a simple thing
done in the sight of all men but a mystery&mdash;so Justin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Martyr calls it&mdash;and the officiant is a "mystagogos."
The baptized are now called "initiate," the unbaptized
"uninitiate." Before the Lord's supper, the priest now
asks, as the mystagogos used to ask, "Is there anyone
who has a quarrel with any?" And until infant baptism
removed the distinction, the "uninitiate" were directed
to withdraw before the consummation of the mystery, as
for unnumbered ages they had been bidden to withdraw
from the crowning rites of the Eleusinia. It is clear that
the founders of Christian mysticism, Clement for instance
and Dionysius the Areopagite, did consciously all in their
power to emphasize the resemblances between the new
and the old. Gregory of Nyssa calls baptism "the mystic
bath," Athanasius calls unction "the mystic oil," Gregory
of Nazianzen calls the elements "mystic food." Secret
formulas, the idea of which comes from the mysteries,
are called by the old name, "what must not be spoken."
Clement speaks the technical language of the mysteries.
"O truly sacred mysteries! O stainless light! My way
is lighted with torches, and I survey the heavens and
God! I am become holy while I am being initiated! The
Lord is my hierophant!"</p>

<p>During the last ten years the researches of Reitzensteim
and Cumont have corrected the first impression that
the influence of mystic cult and language was late and
self-conscious. The very origin of the Christian sacraments,
the very theology of Saint Paul, are now believed
by many scholars to reflect the Hermitic and Gnostic
versions of the mysteries.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The doctrine of the early church underwent as great a
modification as its cult. The studies of Hatch were
directed by the reflection expressed in the first paragraph
of his <i>Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages on the Christian
Church</i>. "It is impossible for anyone, whether he be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
student of history or no, to fail to notice a difference
of both form and content between the Sermon on the
Mount and the Nicene Creed. The Sermon on the Mount
is the promulgation of a new law of conduct; it assumes
beliefs rather than formulates them; the theological conceptions
which underlie it belong to the ethical rather
than the speculative side of theology; metaphysics are
wholly absent. The Nicene Creed is a statement partly
of historical facts and partly of dogmatic inferences; the
metaphysical terms which it contains would probably
have been unintelligible to the first disciples; ethics have
no place in it. The one belongs to a world of Syrian peasants,
the other to a world of Greek philosophers." The
simple first formula of the creed dealt with matters of
fact only, "Jesus Christ and him crucified." At the end
of the second century it included various philosophical
ideas, the creation of the world out of nothing, the Word,
the revelation of the Creator to the world, of the Word or
Son to the Father and of both to men. The Word&mdash;the
<i>logos</i> of Heraclitus and Philo&mdash;threatened to supplant
the Messiah, and originated the endless and bitter controversies
of the early church about the Trinity and the
Incarnation. Christian scholars take pleasure and apparently
pride in deriving the philosophical and ontological
elements of their faith from the Greeks. Dr. Caird
says, "In this case we can see that conquered Greece laid
spiritual fetters on its victor. Greece provided Christianity
with the weapons of culture which enabled it to
subdue the minds of its opponents, but at the same time
it did much to determine the main bias and direction of
the religious consciousness which was established by its
means. It gave its own form to the life and doctrines of
the Church."</p>

<p>The very word "faith" changed its meaning under
Greek influence. When the Hebrews spoke of having faith
in Jehovah they meant that they had confidence in his
character and good intentions. They used the word as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
people used it when they said that they had faith in
Mr. Gladstone. Of course the formula assumed the existence
of Jehovah, as of Mr. Gladstone, but that was supposed
to be an object of knowledge, not of faith. The
disciples again meant by faith the knowledge, direct or
based on direct evidence, of certain historical facts. It
was the Greeks, with their reliance on the processes of
reason, who developed the doctrine that since the reflective
action of the mind is at least as authoritative as the
reports of the senses, the results of its cogitations are the
objects of positive knowledge and faith is the evidence of
things not seen. In a word the reasoned monotheism of the
Greeks, originating, as far as we are concerned, with Plato,
afforded a dialectic basis for the naive monotheism of
the Hebrews. A passage from the writings of Hippolytus,
of the third Christian century, puts the matter clearly
before us: "The one God, the first and sole and universal
Maker and Lord, had nothing coaeval with him, ...
but he was one, alone by himself.... This supreme
and only God begets Reason first, having formed the
thought of him, not reason as a spoken word, but as an
internal mental process of the universe.... The
cause of the things that came into being was the Reason,
bearing in himself the active will of Him who begat
him ... so that when the Father bade the world
come into being, the Reason brought each thing to perfection
thus pleasing God." Obviously persons interested in
tracing the pedigree of the God of Hippolytus will do well
to turn not to <i>Genesis</i> but to Plato's <i>Timaeus</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that the Greek philosophers were the real
fathers of the church, that the theological systems which
have played so dominating a social and political role in
Europe are rooted in the speculations of the great pagans,
is a tribute to the power of Hellas. But the circumstances
under which that power was exerted were unfavorable.
It is interesting to consider what might have been the
religious history of our civilisation if Christianity had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
appeared while the Greek was still not only mythopoeic
but mythocrates, still the master of his creation; if Socrates,
for instance, perhaps the only religious teacher in
history who could have dominated Saint Paul, had been
the apostle to the gentiles, and if the great dynamic power
of Christianity had been attached to the mechanism of
Greek thought at its best. The Greek thought of early
Christian times had become stereotyped; it is often characterized
as sterile, but no adjective could be less apt in
view of the mass and power of the doctrines that sprang
from it. And stereotyped as it was, it was still flexible
in comparison with its Christian offspring. The history
of the word "dogma" is an instructive one. Beginning
with a modest connotation, since it meant only "my impression,"
it stiffened gradually as accumulated authority
adhered to it, yet even to the last in pre-Christian usage
it meant simply a doctrine which one might take or leave.
The union of the Christian notion of divine authority
with the Greek notion of hard and fast definition made
ruinous combination, and gave birth to the Christian
belief that it is sometimes necessary to put a man to the
torture or to the death to correct his ideas.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Christian exegesis also is of Greek origin, but Greek
exegesis sprang in the first place from a rationalistic motive.
The first case of allegorical interpretation of the
scriptures of which we know occurred in the sixth century
before Christ, and was an attempt to moralize one of the
most scandalous passages in Homer, the battle of the
gods in the twentieth book of the Iliad. Reason and
morality had already combined at that time to acknowledge
a uniform course of action in nature, and to make
the gods the guardians of this uniformity. What could
be said therefore of a hand-to-hand scrimmage between
the guardians of the order of the world? Why, it could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
said, and Theagenes of Rhegium said it, that the gods
represented inimical natural powers or inimical passions
of the mind. "Against Hephaestos stood the great deep-eddying
river whom gods call Zanthos and men Scamandros."
Naturally, since fire and water cannot dwell together
in unity. Science adopted this attractive way of
dealing with scripture. Diogenes of Apollonia, who devoted
his life to the effort to reconcile every system to
every other, declared that Homer used the myths to
propagate scientific truth. Antisthenes and the Cynics&mdash;a
preaching order&mdash;developed the method to the full.
When Christianity was making its way into a Hellenized
world, the principle was established that the written
word might have three meanings, the obvious one, the
inferential ethical meaning and the symbolic meaning.
This principle was eagerly adopted by educated Jews, and
applied to their own scriptures. "The application," says
Hatch, "fulfilled a double purpose. It enabled educated
Jews on the one hand to reconcile their own adoption
of Greek philosophy with their continued adhesion to
their ancestral religion, and on the other hand to show to
the educated Greeks with whom they associated, and
whom they frequently tried to convert, that their literature
was neither barbarous nor unmeaning nor immoral."
Christian exegesis naturally adopted the same method
in order to find Christianity everywhere, not only in the
Pentateuch but in Homer. And it was inevitably applied
to the New Testament, for the time came when the
story of the life of Christ needed as much squaring with
theology as the old traditions of the Hebrews. Irenaeus
says, for instance, that "when Simeon took the young
child in his arms and said <i>Nunc dimittis</i>, he was a picture
of the Demiurge who had learned his own change of
place on the coming of the Saviour, and who gave thanks
to the infinite depth." As the pope said later to Father
Tom, "the figgers of spache are the pillars of the church."</p>

<p>Plato had deprecated the symbolic method. He causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
Socrates to say, <i>à propos</i> of the story of Boreas and Oreithyia,
"If I disbelieved it as the philosophers do, I should
not be unreasonable: then I might say, talking like a
philosopher, that Oreithyia was a girl who was caught
by a strong wind and carried off while playing on the
cliffs yonder; but it would take a long and laborious and
not very happy lifetime to deal with all such questions;
and for my own part I cannot investigate them until, as
the Delphian precept bids me, I first know myself."
Plato's own method of exegesis consists quite simply of
expurgation. "The chaining of Hera, and the flinging
forth of Hephaistos by his father, and all the fightings of
gods which Homer has described, we shall not admit into
our state, whether with allegories or without them." To
this method also Christian exegesis owed a great debt.
Plato's famous short way with Homer and the other poets,
his rejection of all myths that do not tend to edification,
and that detract from the goodness of the gods, showed
the fathers how to deal with what scandalized them in
the Hebrew scriptures. Anyone who reads the last pages
of the second book of Plato's <i>Republic</i> will see whence
Clement took his cue when he wrote: "Far be it from us
to believe that the Master of the universe, the Maker of
heaven and earth, 'tempts' men as though he did not
know&mdash;for who then does foreknow? and if he 'repents,'
who is perfect in thought and firm in judgment? and if he
'hardens' men's hearts, who makes them wise? and if
he 'blinds' them, who makes them to see? and if he desires
a 'fruitful hill,' whose then are all things? and if he wants
the savor of sacrifices, who is it that needeth nothing?
and if he delights in lamps, who is it that set the stars in
heaven?"</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>But many feel that all these phenomena&mdash;cult, doctrine
and exegesis, important as they are in the composition
of Christianity, are still not the essential matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Essential Christianity is a state of mind and a rule of life,
and its basis is generally held to be the principles of the
Sermon on the Mount. But while a great many people
assent theoretically to the Sermon on the Mount, no one
has ever put it in practice in its entirety and all the time.
So-called Christian society is not organized on the lines of
the Sermon on the Mount. It is not organized on the
principle of self-abnegation tending to self-perfection,
but on the principle of the development of the individual
as a unit of society, with duties laid upon him by his relation
to society, and rights guaranteed him by the society
he supports. Our ethics are not conceived as founded on
laws god-given and final, but as evolved by the growth of
society, and subject to endless and progressive change.
Where the interest of society requires that the desires of
the bee shall be subordinated to the welfare of the hive,
Christian ethics is often called in as an ally; but if it
were fully in control, society as now organized would disintegrate.
The ethics in which we live and move is that
of Roman law, and Roman law is to a considerable extent
a practical version of the ethics of the Stoics. Moreover
the ethics of the Christian church is based on the doctrine
of Ambrose, bishop of Milan, and the doctrine of Ambrose
is based on Cicero <i>de Officiis</i>, and Cicero's book is based
on the works of Panaetius the Greek stoic of the second
century before Christ. Socrates and Plato had long ago
bidden men to love their enemies, to take no heed for the
morrow, to die rather than do wrong, and to hold their
goods in common. The fathers were astounded by the
Christlike utterances of these pagans, and cried in admiration
that they were Christians before Christianity. When
the old scholiast read how Plato's Socrates said that
"there is no good thing which is not the gift of the gods,"
he wrote on his margin: "Every good gift and every perfect
gift cometh from above." The anti-national character
of Christianity, its determination to ignore frontiers,
was anticipated in the Stoic and Cynic movements. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
world was full of missionaries, and the itinerant Cynic
preacher was very near to the Christian. Epictetus, who
exhorted men to remember that they were sons of God,
and to make their lives worthy of their divine parentage
gives us a picture of the true Cynic apostle. That he
may be free to deliver his message to his fellowmen the
true Cynic goes as naked, homeless, and houseless, as a
Christian apostle. Like the Christian he goes without
wife, child and friends, if only he may thereby bring others
to a knowledge of themselves and of God. We know of
actual cases where Cynics became Christians, and Christians
became Cynics, without any very great ado. It
was, however, the Stoic system, embedded in Roman
institutions, that conquered the world.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It is clear that the Greeks are largely responsible for
bringing religion in Europe to the present <i>impasse</i>, where
many people seriously hold that if we cease to affirm the
incredible and the unproven, morals will suffer, and that
a boy had better believe in hell when he is entrusted
with his first latch-key. But it is the Greek also who can
get us out. Whatever worthy sense we attach to the word
"religious," the Greeks illustrate it. Their extraordinary
moral earnestness is obscured for us only by the variety
of their appeals to our attention. But they never from first
to last allowed religion to swallow morals. They first of
men perceived and declared that morals are man-made and
are constantly to be altered by man; that the state exists
to secure the noblest life for the citizens; that therefore
social science, by definition, (says Aristotle) deals with right
conduct. Plato was deeply interested in all the problems
of religion, and alive to all the religious implications of
the mysterious universe in which we live; but he worked
out in his masterpiece&mdash;<i>The Republic</i>&mdash;a complete
account of the social origin and sanction of ethics. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
as for his theology, "the father and maker of all this
universe," said he, "is past finding out; and even if we
found him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible."</p>

<p>Contemporary writers on religion are trying, thus far
unsuccessfully, to agree on a definition of their subject.
But while no one can define religion, everyone feels what
it is. No society that we know of has been without it,
and there is no reason to suppose that it will ever disappear.
Both religion and morals are apparently social
products, both are, as far as we can see, indestructible,
and both have suffered cruelly from too close a union.
And when they recover their independence, the religious
emotion, like the other emotions, must be governed by
morals.</p>

<h2>OUR SUBLIME FAITH IN SCHOOLING</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Is it <i>not</i> sublime? Really there appears to be no
limit to the demands that are made on our schools
and colleges. They are supposed to ground the rising
generation in the principles and practise of good citizenship,
in morality, and to some extent in religion; to develop
the power to think (an endlessly difficult matter),
the ability to enjoy nature and art, the desire to be useful;
to instil habits of industry, self-control and wholesome
living; and withal to impart <i>memoriter</i> a mass of miscellaneous
book-knowledge such as can be tested by examination.
Of late, too, we hear more and more that
the schools should fit the young for some specific business
in life&mdash;for a job, that is. In short we look to the schools
to inculcate all the possible virtues of mind and character,
and at the same time to turn out what the newest jargon
calls efficient social units. And then there are special
problems, more acute in some places than in others, such
as the induction of alien children into the mysteries of
the English language and American ways.</p>

<p>Now all that makes a pretty big task. It is safe to say
that an army of Pestalozzis, Arnolds and Horace Manns,
if we could command their services and give them all the
money they might ask for, would never perform it to our
entire satisfaction. Here and there we should find loose
ends of failure. What wonder, then, if the schoolma'am,
mostly an ordinary sort of well-meaning mortal, who is
the victim of routine and must do her appointed work
under hopeless conditions of "mass-treatment"&mdash;what
wonder if many people are saying that the schoolma'am
does not seem to measure up to her mission? It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
altogether strange that she is being overtaken by the fate
of Hamlet, whose tragic calamity it was, according to
Goethe, to be obliged to shoulder a burden that was too
heavy for him. In reading educational literature, one is
sometimes reminded of those tribal gods from whom
all things are demanded, and whom it is therefore proper
to scold or to flog if anything goes wrong. For illustration
let me quote a recent deliverance culled from a newspaper.
It is by a man of some distinction, whose name I
do not give because the language is probably nothing but
a reporter's paraphrase. In speaking to an audience on
"the fundamental trouble with conditions and the cause
of the unrest today," the gentleman is said to have laid
it all to "our national educational system, which is teaching
the youth of our land to be consumers instead of producers,
and only to acquire instead of to serve."</p>

<p>There we have it in a nutshell. It is the schools which
are really to blame for the manifold ills that so many
people are talking about. If we only had the right kind
of schools&mdash;teaching the right things in the right way&mdash;our
whole sea of troubles would quickly turn into pleasant
arable land. Historical pundits are just now much interested
in what is called the economic interpretation of
history; that is, the theory that the whole history of man,
including his religions and philosophies and ethnic movements,
his flowerings of art, his Periclean and Augustan
Ages, his Protestant Reformations and French Revolutions&mdash;has
been determined primarily by economic conditions.
And now, behold, the economic conditions themselves
are the work of the schoolma'am. Verily, <i>das
Ewigweibliche zieht uns hinan</i> with a vengeance!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The newest thing is to have the schools cure the ancient
ills that grow out of the pressure of sex&mdash;a subject that
of late seems to claim more than its fair share of the limelight.
The Paris dressmakers, accustomed for ages to
attire women very seductively for evening exhibition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
suddenly take to attiring them rather less seductively
for the street. And lo, the Puritan eye is shocked. There
are visions of social ruin à la Sodom and Gomorrah.
Coincidently the theaters, newspapers and wofsmiths
(Mr. Howells' word, wof meaning work-of-fiction), go in
for the public washing of dirty linen, the existence and
dirtiness of which have been known for some thousands
of years. At the same time a new race of "sociologists"
seek to alarm us by stirring up the foul pool of social
vice and talking about it as if the filth were a thing of the
day before yesterday. Result: a pretty general demand
that the schools teach sex hygiene and physiology, in
order that the boys and girls may be warned betimes of
the dangers that lie in wait for them. I am not arguing
that children should not be told the truth about these
things. I am merely animadverting on the growing tendency
to put everything on the schools.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The natural and intended inference from what precedes
is that we demand too much of the schools&mdash;more than
any schools could possibly do and do well. The result is
that they are often blamed unreasonably, and that reasonable
criticism is apt to be resented as unjust. There is
wide-spread complaint of shortcomings&mdash;some even
speak of the "failure" of popular education,&mdash;but the
teachers reply with perfect truth that they are doing the
best they can. The truth is, however, that there is more
or less floundering due to multiplicity of aims, dispersion
of effort, and the lack of a simple dominating principle
by which to gage the relative importance of things. It is
time for educationists to take sober thought and decide,
if they can, what is on the whole the most valuable among
the possible results of good schooling. If we could somehow
reach a working agreement on that point, the path of
wisdom would be tolerably clear: we should require our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
schools to drive hard at the particular thing deemed most
essential, no matter how many smatterings might have
to be thrown overboard. It were better for the nation
to lose somewhat of its sublime faith in schooling, if by
expecting less it might get a surer and more valuable return
on its enormous investment. The best of teachers, in
kindergarten, high school or university, can never give
the best that is in him unless he has a fairly definite idea
of what it is all for. Only then can he see the main issue
in its proper relation to the side-issues of his routine.
Let us then attack this question with holy boldness&mdash;somewhat
in the spirit of a prudent householder considering
what one thing would be best worth saving if his
house should take fire.</p>

<p>If we look for the fundamental charter of popular education
in these United States we shall find it, if anywhere,
in the famous Ordinance of 1787, one memorable passage
of which runs thus: "Religion, morality and knowledge
being necessary to good government and the happiness
of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever
be encouraged." This formulation, which sees the
purpose of education in the promotion of good government
and the general happiness, may still be accepted.
One might balk, perhaps, at the word "happiness," which
to the modern mind is apt to connote a more or less passive
contentment with one's lot. If the fathers ever
thought that popular education was going to produce
general contentment, they miscalculated. Its normal
effect is the exact opposite. A wholesome discontent is
the beginning of progress toward better things. It is
vain to preach or teach contentment to the man who
sees a chance to better his lot or who feels that he is being
kept down by conditions that can in any wise be remedied.
We have learned that class struggle of one kind or another
is inherent in human society; and where there is class
struggle there will be discontent. Today, then, one might
prefer the word "welfare," which is not only compatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
with discontent, but in great degree actually grows out
of it.</p>

<p>The subject-matter of education was to be religion,
morality and knowledge. Let us consider the impressive
triad in the reverse order.</p>

<p>It is patent enough, and must have been patent to the
fathers, that, so far as good government and the general
welfare are concerned, there is no inherent virtue in mere
knowledge. Knowledge got from books and teachers
may be socially inert, or it may be positively harmful.
Everything depends on the use to which it is put. It is
true that, having regard to the long run, we may rest securely
on the proposition that the more men know&mdash;really
<i>know</i> in an accurate way&mdash;the better off they will
be, and the more likely to secure good government. The
advancement of science&mdash;taking the word in its very
broadest sense&mdash;is certainly an ideal that deserves our
warmest allegiance. It is thus vastly important in any
system of education, to keep open to talent a career from
the humblest hovel to the high places of distinction and
service.</p>

<p>But there are not many&mdash;not one in ten thousand&mdash;to
whom it is given to increase knowledge in a way to
affect government and the general welfare, which must
always be largely concerned with the short run and with
the preservation of a stable order amid the conflicts of
classes, opinions and interests. And in this domain, as
was remarked above, there is no inherent virtue in knowledge.
What is learned in school may be put to bad use
and become a social curse. Some knowledge of chemistry
figures in the mental outfit of every dynamiter and adulterator
of foods. A knowledge of law or medicine may be
used to defeat as well as to promote the ends of justice.
Indeed, a large part of our worst trouble comes now from
"educated" men and women who prostitute their knowledge
to anti-social purposes.</p>

<p>And then there is another reason why the schools should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
not conceive it to be their highest mission to impart book-knowledge,
or to train the mind, as the phrase runs. That
reason is that they do not and can not really train the
mind, when operating on a large number of pupils at the
same time by the method of "recitation." What gets
trained in that way is at best the memory; and when the
pupil leaves school&mdash;at whatever stage of progress&mdash;he
soon forgets what he has learned, unless he has constant
occasion to use it. The result is that the most of the knowledge
laboriously acquired in school and college soon becomes
quite inert for the purposes of good government and
the general welfare. Now it may be necessary, indeed it is
necessary, in a progressive school system, to spend a good
deal of time over knowledges that are destined soon to be
forgotten. But that essential thing that we are searching
for, that which the schools are to regard as the vitally
important thing, must clearly be something that the pupil
is going to need and to use all the time, no matter when
his schooldays come to an end.</p>

<p>Next in our triad comes morality. If any one chooses
to insist at this point that there can be no morality without
religion, let him wait a moment or go off and debate
the subject with a metaphysician. In the common use of
words morality may be and is independent of religion,
and our question here is whether the inculcation of it
can possibly be the thing we are looking for, namely the
chief end of schooling. Hardly, the wise will say, if the
word is to be taken in its usual sense. For it is distinctly
a low-caste word. People commonly speak of "mere
morality" as if the thing by itself did not amount to much.
One recalls the remark of Emerson to the effect that this
is very much as if one should say, "Poor God with nobody
to help him." Still, the fact remains that the word connotes
something rather ordinary. This is why Lord Haldane
in a recent address preferred to avoid it and to
commend the German <i>Sittlichkeit</i>, as a more soulful term.
One notices, too, that thoughtful teachers who feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
weakness of a schooling that lays all the stress on memory-work
such as can be tested by examination, are apt, when
they wish to suggest something higher and larger, to use
some such phrase as "character-building" rather than
"moral training."</p>

<p>In short, the connotations of the word "morality" are
such as to put it out of the running as a name for a high
educational ideal; and a high ideal we must of course
have. It suggests hardly more than what Mr. Roosevelt
is wont to call "decent living;" and decent living is not
a matter that can very well be progressively unfolded,
idealized and realized. For a pupil coming from a family
where decent living is the rule, and associating with mates
of whom the same is true, it is not much to live decently.
There is almost nothing for him to learn. This is no
doubt why it is generally assumed, and in the main quite
correctly, that in a normally wholesome environment
morality will take care of itself or come as a by-product of
school experience, the teacher having nothing in particular
to do except to look after the occasional transgressor.</p>

<p>But now suppose we put in place of mere morality, the
perfection of the social mind. Suppose we say that the
central purpose of popular education ought to be the
<i>development of a sensitive social conscience enlightened to
the limits of opportunity</i>. To put it a little differently:
suppose we could agree that the best possible result of
education is a mind trained and habituated to think in
terms of social obligation, and to act accordingly. We
should then have, at any rate, something that is high
enough and big enough for anybody; something that is
capable of progressive realization from the kindergarten
to the university and thereafter; something, in fine, that
would reach out from the humblest ego to the utmost
periphery of human existence.</p>

<p>Thirdly, religion. Let it be granted at the outset that
for an immense number of the noblest souls that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
ever lived "Thou God seest me" has been the highest,
most inclusive, most compelling incentive to right social
conduct, that we know anything about. In practise,
however, a great deal depends on the nature of the God
that is feared, and still more, perhaps, on whether that
God is really and truly feared or only spoken of with
conventional respect in token of some ecclesiastical loyalty.
Can religion be "taught" in school&mdash;any kind of
school? Can it be taught, I mean, not as a matter of
formal observance and glib recitation, but in its vital
essence as a quickening spirit destined to stick fast in
the character and be a permanent incentive to right living?
It is only in this sense that the "teaching" of religion
has any bearing on good government and the general
welfare.</p>

<p>The difficulty of teaching religion in this socially effective
way is not confined to the secular public schools. It
does not grow entirely out of the neutrality of the state,
the jealousy of sects and the impossibility of finding a
common basis free from any sectarian tinge. It goes
deeper than that, and affects also church schools that fly
the banner of religion and are conducted for the express
purpose of giving prominence to the beliefs and usages of
some particular denomination. What can be done to
teach religion? Of course the pupil can be exposed to
what are called religious influences, and made to breathe
what is called a religious atmosphere. He can be required
to attend chapel exercises, and to go to church on Sunday;
to read the Bible or hear it read; to memorize texts,
creeds, hymns and commandments. He can learn church
history, and familiarize himself with the arguments and
tenets of "our people." But when, as is usually the case,
all this precedes any vital personal experience of religion,
it is apt presently to float away, along with the Latin and
algebra, into the limbo of things once known but no
longer usable. The teaching of religion so that it will
stick fast, not merely as an ecclesiastical loyalty, but as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
socially regenerative force, is a very difficult matter.
Multitudes of parents who are profoundly anxious about
the matter, fail in the home, clergymen fail rather notoriously
with their own sons and daughters. Can the
school be expected to succeed where they are baffled?</p>

<p>But suppose it were understood that the supreme purpose
of all education, no matter what banner the schoolhouse
or college might fly, is the development of character
trained and habituated to think in terms of social obligation,
and to act accordingly: should we not then have a
formula on which all who really mean well by their fellowmen
could unite? For surely the perfection of the social
mind&mdash;that and nothing else&mdash;is the finest flower of
the religious spirit.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There are reasons for thinking that such a theory of
popular education as has been outlined, and a modified
practise based on the theory, are needed at the present
time as a measure of social therapeutics. Without joining
the prophets of evil who think we are moving swiftly
toward a social revolution, one may say in all sobriety
that there are signs which look ominous for the future of
our democratic experiment. It is not merely that there
is wide-spread discontent and a general breaking away
from old standards and restraints. All that, which is
apt to look so threatening to elderly people, especially
if they are not much given to the reading of history, may
be nothing but the sign of healthy life and growth. Stable
democratic society may consist with almost any amount of
discontent, provided it discharges itself by way of legal
channels duly provided for the purpose in advance.</p>

<p>But the really menacing symptom of our time, is in a
word,&mdash;lawlessness. I have not chiefly in mind the shocking
and increasing prevalence of outrageous crimes against
person and property. That is certainly bad enough.
That life and property are not as safe in the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
as they were a generation ago, and not as safe as they are
today in the British Empire, France, Germany, Switzerland
and the Scandinavian countries, is surely a fact to
give us pause. And yet, in that fact alone there is nothing
highly ominous for the future of democracy. In all ages,
under all forms of government, there have been murderers,
thieves and ravishers, but social order has never
been destroyed or even seriously imperiled by them.
Society has found ways to protect itself. The statistics
of crime vary from decade to decade under the operation
of causes that are fairly well understood by experts. An
excess at any time can be corrected by known methods if
a people sets resolutely about it.</p>

<p>The danger lies rather in a diminishing respect for law
as such among large masses of the nominally respectable
population. Multitudes have come to look on the will
of the community as expressed in law, not as an obligation
binding on the conscience, but as a sort of solemn joke&mdash;something
meant for the other fellow. This cynicism
with regard to law has become a veritable cancer of the
social body. The matter is difficult to treat statistically,
but surely there can be no doubt about it. It is no illusion
of perspective, not the nightmare of a pessimist, but
simple damning truth, that the law-abiding spirit has of
late been losing ground rapidly. The case is not stated
too strongly by a recent writer when he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In spite of his vulnerability he [the capitalist] is of all citizens
the most lawless. He appears to assume that the law will
always be enforced by some special personnel whose duty lies
that way, while he may evade the law, when convenient, or
bring it into contempt, with impunity. The capitalist seems
incapable of feeling his responsibility as a member of the governing
class, in this respect, and that he is bound to uphold the
law that others may do the like.... He therefore looks
on the evasion of a law devised for public protection, but inimical
to him, as innocent or even meritorious.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course there are many honorable exceptions; indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
this very remark is made by Mr. Adams himself. It may
be said too that the influential men who fall as a class
under this sweeping indictment can often allege a colorable
excuse for their anti-social conduct&mdash;as that the law
they try to "beat" was devised in ignorance or malice
by corrupt politicians. And so they play the game of
money against politics, and are not aware of the social
menace of their conduct. They subordinate the greater
to the less, and know not what they do&mdash;any more than
the aristocracy and clergy of France knew what they
were doing just prior to 1789. They think themselves the
salt of the earth. Many of them are more or less zealous
church-members, and have had a "religious education."
And yet, in playing fast and loose with the law, they are
playing with fire in their own cellars. When a ruling
class&mdash;our government is a qualified plutocracy&mdash;loses
its sense of responsibility, and takes to violating the law,
it takes the surest way to bring all law into contempt.
And when the general contempt for law reaches a certain
point, then comes anarchy and&mdash;the strong man on horse-back
to tell us what to do, and shoot us if we don't do it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The vocation of the croaker is not lightly tolerated by
the public opinion of our day. Every one votes him a
nuisance. A deep-seated American optimism expects
that we shall somehow weather the storms of the future
as we have weathered those of the past. The writer of
these reflections has the national temperament, but he
thinks the time has come to reef sails and trim ship. For
law and obedience to law there must be, if society is to
cohere and go on its way; and in a democracy lawlessness
is not so much <i>a</i> peril as <i>the</i> peril. We must look to our
democratic foundations, lest they be undermined while
we go on gaily amusing ourselves, piling up money, and
assuring each other that everything is all right in the
best government the sun ever shone upon. There is need
of a vast co-operative effort on the part of all the ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
forces of society&mdash;an effort directed consciously and
vigorously to the specific end of checking and turning
back the rising tide of lawlessness. There is work for the
home, for the church, for the voluntary association; and
of course there is work for the school, with which we are
here more immediately concerned.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>What can the schools do for the better training of the
social conscience? (I use the word "training" in the
double sense of habituation and enlightenment). It is
evident that that question needs more space than can be
given to it here. A few words must suffice.</p>

<p>In the first place, teachers can recognize&mdash;that is, they
can gradually be brought to recognize&mdash;that the training
of the social conscience is the great work they have
to do; that it is more important than anything else. A
general recognition of that fact would itself have a highly
stimulating effect. It would clarify ideas, furnish criteria
of value that would be independent of personal or local
whim, divert attention from piddling questions of routine,
and so do something to elevate the business of teaching
in the public estimation. It is now commonly spoken
of as a noble profession, but only a very few really think
of it in that light. In the better atmosphere I am thinking
of, the teacher would not be a drill-sergeant bossing the
details of a mental lock-step, but the physician of the
social conscience. And, in harmony with the new drift
in medicine, our physician would pin his faith to preventive
treatment. He would not be able to avoid some
punishment of the wrong-doer, but he would see his
highest mission in the development of a sensitive conscience
that would inhibit wrong-doing. This means
skillful and well-paid teachers for children, not too many
pupils to the teacher, and much friendly study of the
individual pupil in school and out.</p>

<p>Then again teachers could put into practise far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
generally than has been attempted hitherto, what has
been found out by scientific men with regard to the social
conscience and the way it works. They could appeal in
every possible way to the social instinct, and make use
of its well-known rewards and inhibitions. The foundation
principle would be to make the penalty for misbehavior
take the form, so far as possible, of social disapproval,
with consequent suffering in self-esteem. To
be effective, a penalty needs to be quick-acting and sure.
It should depend as little as possible on the accident of
getting caught. If a potential miscreant is taught to fear
punishment at the hands of some authority outside of
and above his own life, and if then he does wrong, and
nothing unpleasant happens, he soon begins to enjoy the
game of matching his wits against the law. Pretty soon
he is really being schooled in the exciting art of law-breaking.
Somehow he must learn to dread the disapproval
of his mates and the prick of his own conscience.</p>

<p>Another principle, hardly less fundamental, would be
to make the learner see that the rules he is called on to
obey, at work or at play, are for the general good, <i>including
his own</i>. Of course difficulty would be created by the
young anarchist, the imp who refuses to play the game in
accordance with the rules, is insensitive to communal
opinion, and enjoys the excitement of beating the law.
Such a mental twist is generally due to a vicious environment
in home or street, where the standards are different
from those of the school. How to deal with such cases,
when they have reached the advanced stage of criminality,
has always been one of the hardest problems of the civilized
man, and no very satisfactory solution of it has yet
been found. Down to quite recent time, our forbears
put their faith in the deterrent effect of harsh and public
punishments; and the rod of the schoolmaster kept pace,
so to speak, with the stern decrees of the criminal law. It
was found not to work very well, a humaner epoch set in,
and with that too the schools have kept pace. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
come to feel that society itself is to blame for the miscreant,
because it creates and perpetuates the conditions
that make him. Meanwhile society is experiencing the
disastrous effects of dealing gently with the criminal, and
the schools are breeding up a generation to which anything
like stern discipline is on the whole rather repugnant.</p>

<p>The one hopeful idea on the horizon is the idea of prevention.
The potential miscreant must be caught and
cured in the early stages of his making. It is unfortunately
true that even the most enlightened and single-minded
efforts of the school will produce but lame results so long
as society permits criminals to breed with their kind,
and tolerates the economic conditions which create for
decently born children a hopelessly bad environment
outside the schoolroom. It is for society to remedy these
conditions as fast as it can. Meanwhile much would be
gained if we could once clearly see, and begin to act on
the principle, that the <i>chief end</i> of popular education
should be, not a smattering of knowledges, but the development
of social-minded character.</p>

<h2>THE BARBARIAN INVASION</h2>

<p class="center"><span style="margin-left:4em;">Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes</span><br />
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.</p>


<p>Readers of Thackeray will remember that these
are the lines in which Colonel Newcome used regretfully
to sing the praises of those arts into which he had
been but barely initiated. Of the thousands in the United
States who are now annually certified as bachelors of arts,
nine-tenths would be unable to translate the passage, and
if the passage were translated, fully one-half would see
little or nothing in it. When men are asking what is the
matter with our colleges, one is tempted to suggest
that perhaps this is the matter: that a controlling interest
in the academic establishment is made up of those who
have no belief that higher education should result in
refinement of mind and transformation of character, and
no comprehension of what these things would mean; or,
in plain terms, that higher education is in the hands of the
barbarians.</p>

<p>That our academic population has grown some three
or four-fold within a generation, is no indication of a
corresponding increase in the number of persons of cultivated
intelligence. The growth has been brought about
mainly through a change in the tone and purpose of the
college course to appeal to those who formerly despised
a college education as a useless luxury; so that now we
have a large number of college graduates in whose eyes
the degree confers no distinction and imposes no responsibility.
It may be that the older science was crude and
the older scholarship vague. By no means all college students
of a generation ago were animated by a love of
knowledge. Yet even the idlers, who sought the degree
because it was reputable, testified to a general respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
for higher education, and bore witness to the idea that a
college graduate was supposed to be a gentleman. No
such expectation prevails today; and least of all in the
West, where the increase of numbers has been most
marked. Today a college education is supposed to be
merely useful. Yet at the same time it is felt to be a
ground for wonder that so many can pass through the
college course with no visible refinement of taste or speech,
no clarification of the sense of honor and justice, and no
increase in thoughtfulness or in independence of mind&mdash;that,
in a word, a college graduate is indistinguishable
in general society. Some time ago I sat at a hotel table
with six commercial travellers and one college graduate,
who was also a college professor,&mdash;all talking baseball.
Sherlock Holmes himself could not have identified the
professor. Some time before, I had ventured to propose
in a talk to some students that a college degree should
impose the obligation of <i>noblesse</i>, and preserve a man
from some of the meaner things which might be condoned
in the less fortunate. I learned afterwards that the idea
was resented as "undemocratic"&mdash;yet not by the students:
for today it seems to be the college professor who
is chiefly contemptuous of liberal culture.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to see how <i>higher</i> education is to be
conceived as "democratic" in the sense of creating no
personal distinctions. Only, it should seem, if the gifts
of education are purely external and without effect upon
mind and character. On the other hand, if democracy is
to stand simply for freedom of opportunity, and selection
of the best, doubtless few will deny that the college should
be open to every youth who shows himself capable of
measuring up to the idea of an educated man. But this
is another matter. The "democratic" theory of higher
education stands for a process of measuring down. The
process began when the teachers of science insisted that a
student whose course was made up mostly of laboratory
practice in natural science should nevertheless be graduated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
as a bachelor of arts. One may cheerfully admit the
importance of scientific conceptions for general culture:
the point is that if scientific training had developed half
of the intellectual qualities that were claimed for it, the
degree in science should soon have displaced that of bachelor
of arts. As it was, the issue was obscured, and under
the blessings of the blanket degree, "democracy" has
made rapid progress. No form of speech is now too destitute
of ideas to be called a science. Leaving aside the
last new science of "efficiency," we have a science of
cooking and of dressmaking, a science of carpentering
(called manual training), a science of commerce, a science
of journalism, and a science of football, any of which
may now entitle one to credit towards a degree of bachelor
of arts&mdash;so that no one can now charge that the college
degree implies an invidious distinction.</p>

<p>Such is the outcome of "democracy." At first glance
the term conveys the pleasing suggestion that our universities
attach a high importance to the cultivation of
individuality. But the suggestion is misleading. In the
academic "democracy" every student, like every dollar,
counts for just one "and nobody for more than one," and
the only question of importance is how many. Not long
ago, while crossing the Rocky Mountains, and listening to
the admiration expressed by my fellow-travelers for the impressive
engineering and industrial undertakings of that
region and the Pacific Coast, I became gradually aware
that the conventional mode of describing such an enterprise
was to speak of it as "a two-million-dollar plant"
or "twenty-million-dollar plant," as the case might be,
on the ground, evidently, that no other aspect of the matter
could conceivably be interesting. Such barbaric innocence
seemed to me diverting until I remembered that
this was the point of view and these the same tribe of
barbarians as those whose aspirations now control the
policies of our institutions of learning. With few exceptions,
our academic managers prefer to state their attainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
and their ambitions in terms of an n-million dollar
plant, with n-thousand students and n-hundred instructors.
And in the interest of bigness any argument is good.
Just now the argument is vocational, and college presidents
and professors, especially in the state-universities
of the West, are fairly falling over one another to prove
that they are "practical men," and incidentally to disavow
any interest in the promotion of liberal culture. When
the fashion changes, as it doubtless will&mdash;for it is unlikely
that even the agricultural communities are as uncivilised
as the appeal that is made to them&mdash;the argument will
change. Especially instructive from this point of view
is the standing appeal for more money to make good a
deficit; or to improve the quality of instruction by paying
better salaries to the faculty. In the logic of academic
administration there appears to be no contradiction between
pleading poverty and at the same time using the
funds in hand to establish some new department, some
advertising feature, such as a summer session, correspondence
courses, university extension, or what not, which
will attract a more illiterate class of students, scatter the
energies of the faculty, lower their teaching efficiency,
preserve the deficit, and leave the institution less than
ever free to shape its own course or to act as a critic of
popular opinion.</p>

<p>Academic authorities are accustomed to explain these
seeming inconsistencies by a vague appeal to the obligations
of the university to the community. These "social
obligations" will repay a careful study. To grasp the
idea that is now current in most of the state-universities,
one must think of a state-hospital for the insane in which
the care of patients is regarded as secondary to the purpose
of impressing the people of the state with the evil of insanity,
and the need of larger appropriations for the
state-hospital. A careful analysis of present academic
conceptions of "social obligation" fails to show that such
obligation differs in any essential respect from the obligation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of a merchant to procure new customers, and incidentally
to take some of them away from his competitors.
The merchant's obligation is made humanly intelligible by
considerations of profit or prestige. It is rather difficult
to grasp the sort of academic prestige that comes from
cheapening the college degree. And when we find that
even the older and richer institutions show a disposition
to sacrifice their academic distinction for the prestige of
numbers, it seems simpler to abandon the search for rational
motive, and to refer the ambitions of our institutions
of learning to the same primitive instinct that
prompts one man or woman to outshine his neighbor in
the splendor of his diamonds or his dinners, and another
in the size of his motor-car.</p>

<p>A sure key to the interpretation of "social obligation"
will be found in inter-collegiate athletics. I am speaking
here, not of athletic sports as such, nor necessarily of
athletic contests between colleges, but of inter-collegiate
contests as a matter of public exhibition&mdash;"a Roman
holiday"&mdash;and commercial enterprise. Only a finely
drawn distinction saves the college athlete from being
classed as a professional. It is true that (as a rule) he
does not pay for his living out of the gate-receipts. But
the gate-receipts pay for his sport, and the sport covers
a good deal of expensive traveling and sojourning at expensive
hotels, not to speak of the services of a professional
coach, now commonly appointed by the college
administration at a salary often higher than that of a full
professor. And when we remember that the gate-receipts
total many thousands&mdash;$50,000 from a single game is
not uncommon&mdash;and further that such sums are needed
to maintain the sport at its present (shall we not say
"professional"?) perfection, it is hard to see that amateur
sport is not a business enterprise of serious dimensions.
The difficulty becomes greater if we define a man's profession
to be that which consumes most of his time and
attention. This applies especially to football. The very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
purpose of the training is to provide that during the season
no member of the team shall waste his time or strength
on any other purpose. The schedule for practice would
be sufficient to demonstrate this point, apart from the
testimony of numerous football men, among them men
of fair ability and conscientious students. During the
season they can do little more than attend their classes
and trust to the mercy of the instructor. This mercy they
are pretty sure to receive, first, because they have, as a
rule, carefully avoided electing the courses of the unmerciful,
secondly, because even a rather independent instructor
will often prefer to give a football man the grade needed
to keep him on the team rather than face a storm of execration
from students and colleagues, not to speak of a
long argument in the president's office. Such arguments
are not uncommon; and a college professor who attaches
any importance to the reports published of the high average
of scholarship maintained by athletes must be lacking
in a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Older apologists for inter-collegiate athletics were accustomed
to talk about <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>. But
every one knows now that inter-collegiate athletics are as
little related to sound health as inter-collegiate debates
to sound logic. Nor does it suffice to point to the need
of a safety-valve for the spirits of youth. This argument
may pass for some of the Eastern colleges, but the Western
student is apt to be a sober and steady, if somewhat unimaginative
youth, who looks at college mostly from
a business standpoint; and it is fair to say that inter-collegiate
sports would have amounted to little in the
West if they had not been carefully fostered by the college
administration. This is so far true that a youth who
happens to be husky and strong can hardly hope to escape
the football team except under the imputation of "disloyalty;"
and more than one who had hoped to give his
time to other things has yielded to the importunities, not
so much of his fellow-students as of the faculty sports and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
those connected with the administration. In the college
community generally, and in the speeches made by the
faculty before gatherings of students, the highest tribute
is reserved for the athletic heroes. Those who win college
honors, or who make Phi Beta Kappa or Sigma Xi, are
rarely heard of. The present theory seems to be&mdash;and
again, the theory, not so much of the students as of the
faculty and administration&mdash;that the student who wins
honors work only for himself, while he who helps win a
game does something for the college.</p>

<p>A generation ago the management of athletics was in
the hands of the students, and the faculty was content
to confine itself to the task of keeping the games within
proper limits. But the amount of money involved became
too great for undergraduate business methods and,
in some cases, for undergraduate honesty. Hence, in
one college after another, the administration assumed
the direction of athletics in the interest of good management
and at the same time, it was claimed, of preserving
their amateur character. This claim has been very
strangely justified. The result has been rather that in
the hands of the administration athletics became an instrument
of competition, and for the first time a serious
and important business; and in the prosecution of the
business along professional lines, the administration has
been shown to be, not more scrupulous than the undergraduates,
but only more resourceful. Impecunious athletes
could now be provided for by scholarships or by places
in the library, the college office, or the college book-store.
Why, pray, should a student be debarred from the privilege
of "working his way through" because he happens
to be an athlete? Or why, for this reason, should a president
be deprived of the benevolent satisfaction of helping
a deserving student out of his own pocket? Or why should
a similar privilege be withheld from "loyal" alumni or
from disinterested persons who happen to have money
on the game? Cases of this kind are matters of common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
report in academic circles; and when players are disqualified
for professionalism by the inter-collegiate conference,
the circumstances point not seldom to complicity
on the part of the academic authorities. Among men of
the world who are gentlemen, it is thought to be one of
the primitive moralities to be a good sport&mdash;to play the
game on the square and to treat your opponent as a gentleman.
Neither of these points seems to be quite intelligible
to many of our academic sports. One college president
might be named whose speeches at football "rallies" are
said to suggest an expedition against savages.</p>

<p>A private citizen who should set up a billiard table in
his house, and then earn the cost of it by giving exhibition
games for admission fees, would be promptly put down
as a professional sport. I have suggested to a number of
colleagues that college athletics will never be a gentleman's
sport until the gate-receipts are abolished, the
professional coach dismissed, and the scope of athletics
is limited to what can be supported by private subscription,
preferably confined to students. One can readily see
how this would improve the <i>morale</i> of athletics. There
would be some loss of proficiency, but in matters of sport
no gentleman can afford to be too proficient. The usual
reply has been, however, "Oh, that would never do."
Now of course it would never do. But there is just one
reason why, namely, that athletics are today regarded
as the most important measure and criterion of academic
prestige. They are indeed an abominable nuisance. They
absorb the attention of the administration, take up the
time of faculty meetings or of governing committees, send
traveling about the country students who ought to be
at work, and give to the members of the team a public
importance which their personality fails to justify. But
every institution feels itself bound to make a good showing
for fear that a barbarian public, and the rich barbarians
among the alumni, will judge that it is lacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
in vitality. The fear is doubtless exaggerated, but such
is the <i>rationale</i> of inter-collegiate athletics.</p>

<p>Further light upon the "social obligations" of our colleges
and universities will be afforded by a study of the
departments of education, or teachers' colleges, which
have been established in most of the larger institutions,
and which now often receive a greater share of the attention
of the administration than any other part of the institution.
It is unnecessary to ask whether the history
or philosophy of education are important subjects of
study. The fact remains that the history of education
is about as necessary a preliminary to the practice of
teaching, as the history of medicine to the practice of
medicine, while any genuine philosophy of education
implies a broad basis of ripe culture. Nor may we question
the need of a higher standard of general culture for
the teachers in the secondary schools. All of this is irrelevant
to the department of education. The very last thing
named there is the need of broad culture and sound
knowledge. On the contrary, the idea is commonly conveyed
that a too thorough knowledge of the subject will
be bad for the teacher. As I write, there comes to me
the published report of a speech by the dean of one of the
teachers' colleges, who says that "it is harder for a Phi
Beta Kappa to learn to teach than for medium students."
Of course the moral is clear: no student who intends to
teach, and who hopes to receive an appointment, can
afford to waste his time in making a record for excellence
of scholarship and breadth of culture, such as would
recommend him to Phi Beta Kappa, especially since any
deficiencies in these directions can be more than made
good by a "professional training" in child-psychology,
the science of method, and the social aims of education.</p>

<p>The result of this appeal is to bring to the university
a large class of students whose personal ambition does
not extend beyond the desire for a comfortable job, and
who regard the university, not as an <i>alma mater</i>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
simply as an emporium from which they may procure a
professional outfit; and at the same time to instal in the
faculty a set of men whose prevailing point of view is
that of the <i>entrepreneur</i>. In all of our universities, from
the Atlantic coast to the Pacific, the department of education,
with its courses, students, and instructors, is
an object of ridicule and malediction on the part of most
of the faculty. Even the less fastidious are disposed to
resent the presence in the university of a department
whose intellectual and cultural status is hardly superior
to that of a normal school. There would seem to be only
one reason for the importance attached to the department
by the administration, namely, the large and steady
constituency which it is able to command through the
questionable logic of its vocational appeal. For the purpose
of enlarging the "plant," nothing better has been yet
devised than the plan of offering "professional training"
for teachers.</p>

<p>Hardly less significant, however, for a study of the
social obligations resting upon our universities is the
graduate school. In the West local patriotism demands
that every state shall have its state-university, and no
institution is a complete university without a graduate
school. That several states should combine to form one
graduate school of really good quality has, to my knowledge,
never been suggested. Meanwhile, to measure the
urgency of the need for graduate schools, it will be sufficient
to contemplate the kind of men who are awarded
fellowships in the graduate schools already well established,
in the East or in the West. A dispassionate observer
might readily conclude that the capacity of the
country for graduate work had been satisfied for a century
to come. And he would be the more confirmed in his
opinion if he should reflect upon the cost of graduate
instruction, the small number of students who attend
the graduate courses, and the few who are not subsidized
to attend. In his book on <i>University Control</i> Professor Cattell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
has called attention to the fact that our
graduate schools procure most of their students only by
paying them, and to the more significant fact that, with
all the inducements offered by scholarships and fellowships,
the material is of not more than mediocre quality.
Even at Harvard it has been noted that the graduate
students were as a class inferior in personal genius and
intellectual endowment to the best class of undergraduates.
Nor does it seem worth while to increase the stipend.
Some years ago one of our college presidents, an artist in
inflation, conceived the idea of splitting his fellowships
into two; with a scarcely observable change of quality,
he obtained two graduate students for the price of one.
From all this one would be led to conclude that what is
now needed is, not more graduate schools, but a working
outfit of really eligible students for those already established.</p>

<p>Since the college faculty is recruited from the graduate
school, this means that there is a corresponding lack of
eligible material for college professorships. Professor
Cattell suggests that the lack of good material for the
graduate fellowships is due to the unsatisfactory conditions
which, in America, surround the profession of scholar
and teacher. Doubtless this is true, but the deeper fact
seems to be that cultural conditions in the United States
have not yet developed a sufficient number of men with
a taste for academic work to fill the places created by a
policy of hasty expansion. The result is that a fair number
of those composing our college faculties&mdash;fully half,
one might say, viewing them as a whole,&mdash;are men who
have no special sense of professional dignity or of professional
responsibility; and some of those who write
"Professor" before, or "A.B., Ph.D." after their names
are all but illiterate. An unselected group of college professors
leaves no impression of special culture. Their
ordinary conversation conveys no impression of superior
insight in matters of politics, or of art, or of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
reform&mdash;very probably the subject of conversation is
football and the prospects of the team. In any community
a group of college professors is likely to represent, not a
higher level of culture, but simply a fairly assorted average,
a vertical section, so to speak, of the culture of the community.
Under normal conditions many of those who
now compose our college faculties would probably be
teaching in the elementary schools, while others, especially
those, now highly esteemed by the administration, who
prefer the stir and bustle of traveling and speech-making
to the humdrum of study and teaching, would be carrying
a case of samples or selling life-insurance. One of the
striking things about our college professors is their
frequent distaste for quiet occupations. Hence, while it is
true that the conditions prevailing in the profession react
upon the graduate schools, the reverse is also true. One
reason that operates against better salaries for college
professors is that so many are now worth no more than
they get, while for men of a better quality there is no
immediately promising source of supply.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is obvious that a policy of indiscriminate
expansion is committed to the employment of
Chinese cheap labor in teaching. To this necessity we
owe the elaborate academic hierarchy extending through
the grades of fellow, assistant, instructor, assistant professor,
associate professor, full professor, to the culminating
dignity of "professor and head of the department;" to
this we owe the employment of women in the coëducational
colleges (who rarely get beyond the grade of instructor);
and to this we owe the fact that, even in the oldest and
richest of our universities, a great part of the instruction
is given by instructors at about a thousand dollars a year.
Yet all the while a course by a thousand-dollar instructor
yields the same amount of credit towards the degree as a
course by a full professor. From the administration's
standpoint, however, it is foolish to pay four or five
thousand dollars for one man when you can get two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
three for that sum; and especially when your public is of a
kind that only a small portion of it will know the difference.</p>

<p>Peculiarly favorable to this policy has been the importation
from Germany of the <i>wissenschaftliche Methode</i> and,
in particular, of the scientific method of creating a Doctor
of Philosophy, based upon the curious Teutonic conception
of a "contribution to knowledge." One such contribution
is sufficient for a Doctor of Philosophy; the number
of them is the measure of a scientific reputation. What
is positively needed to constitute a contribution to knowledge,
is not altogether clear. It seems quite certain, however,
that a contribution to knowledge need not be a
contribution to ideas. And a census of the contributions
printed by the journals devoted to special departments
of knowledge suggests that little more is needed than an
industrious description of some region of unexplored fact.
It matters little that the fact is insignificant, or that the
analysis (if there be analysis) throws no new light upon
the principles of science or upon the motives of history or
of literature&mdash;a fact is still a fact; and a "negative result"
in response to an improbable hypothesis is still a
"contribution." It is evident that the "scientific method,"
whatever be its first intention, need not in practice imply
the operation of intelligence. And this may help to explain
why the "results of science" are occasionally indistinguishable
from those of manual labor, and how a man may rank
as a scientific authority whose general intelligence would
not clearly distinguish him from an ordinary carpenter or
bricklayer. All of this, indeed, is implied in the logic of
"method." As the purpose of a machine is to be foolproof,
so is it the purpose of scientific method to make
scientific discovery independent of personal endowment
or genius. In the wholesale creation of academic establishments
the method plays a particularly important part,
since it furnishes a supply of accredited reputations at a
relatively moderate cost.</p>

<p>The scientific method represents the introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
"democracy" into the fields of science and scholarship.
And thus it enables us to explain the paradox, otherwise
mystifying, that college professors are the first to teach
the student to attach a superior importance to men of
affairs; to value a practical experience of things above a
clear understanding of them; the intuitions of the plain
man, or of the child of nature, above the decisions of
reflective judgment; and that they are the first to warn
him against allowing plain common sense to be disturbed
by the exercise of reason. All of this would be rather
perplexing if one were unfamiliar with the democratic
theory that a contribution to knowledge implies no exercise
of intelligence, and that intellectual discipline works
no change in the quality of the man.</p>

<p>When, however, it becomes a question of democracy
for the faculty&mdash;or, in other words, of a form of academic
administration appropriate to the idea of a learned profession&mdash;the
democrats of this type are apt to be either
silent or contemptuous. One of the reasons why academic
administration is imperialistic in democratic America,
while it is democratic in imperialistic Germany, is that
American scholars have no illusions regarding the dignity
of their profession. On the other hand, a commercial,
or, if you please, scientific, theory of academic organization
leads quite naturally to the conception of the college-president
as a captain of industry&mdash;while a study of the
acts of college professors in their corporate capacity as a
faculty might easily lead one to believe that most of them
are capable only of doing what they are told. But all
this is but one manifestation of a deeper reason. For a
true basis of comparison, we must turn, not to the German
university, but to the German army, and then back again
to the citizen soldiery of the United States. On a peace
footing, if academic progress be the end in question, there
appears to be no reason why a body of academic teachers,
presumably men of culture and of experience in academic
affairs, should not be able to govern an educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
institution both efficiently and progressively under the
presiding direction of one of their number responsible to
themselves. Nor may we see why any scholar should
be disinclined to interrupt his studies for a term to assume
the office. But for an aggressive campaign against the
state-treasury, or the pockets of the wealthy, or a raid
upon the constituency of a rival institution, such a form
of organization would be as little fitted as our National
Guard for an invasion of Canada. A campaign of conquest
calls for the autocratic powers of a captain of industry.</p>

<p>In institutions of established reputation, the tradition
of culture is usually strong enough to demand that the
president be a scholar and a man of distinction&mdash;though
he need not be a conspicuous illustration of the theory
that familiarity with the arts <i>emollit mores, nec sinit esse
feros</i>. A glance, however, at what is expected of the
president in the great majority of colleges and universities
will convince one that it is easier for the rich man to enter
the Kingdom of Heaven than for the president to live up
to the ideal of a scholar and a gentleman. It will also help
to account for the number of strange and even grotesque
characters which have figured in the office. Every one
has known college presidents whose personality would
suggest the politician, the promoter, the theatrical manager,
or the quack-doctor&mdash;anything rather than the
head of an institution of learning. When a professor is
elevated to the presidency, he ceases to be a teacher, and
becomes an "educator" (with a long <i>o</i>). The duties of
the office leave no time, as a rule, either for teaching or
for study&mdash;for which, doubtless, those who have been
"training" for the office are often grateful. The result is
that the educational manager is usually far removed from
the realities of education. And, indeed, the last thing of
which our college presidents are expected to have any
personal knowledge is the courses that are given in their
institution and the ideas of the instructor who is giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
them. What is chiefly demanded of them is "executive
ability," especially that kind of which the chief ingredient
is a histrionic capacity for attracting attention.</p>

<p>Thus the duties of the office are only remotely academic.
On the side of internal administration, the first
duty of the president is to swell the volume of "life" by
a paternal encouragement, mingled at times with insistence,
of all the organizations representing "student interests"&mdash;those
athletic, first of all, but then the countless
other societies, religious, social, dramatic, musical,
terpsichorean, journalistic, forensic, or what not, which
give a tone of "vitality" to our academic life (or, as you
may choose to put it, make a howling wilderness of the
academic halls); and among which the literary society
of the older days is the least considered. If college life is
to yield material for publicity nothing should be left to
the student's spontaneity; on the other hand, the modern
college student is apt to blame the administration if he is
backward in making friends or fails to make a place
for himself among his fellows. On the side of external
administration, the duties of the president may be summed
up in the two words, money and publicity. To procure
the first of these, he is expected to make himself acceptable
to men of wealth; or, in the state-university, to the politicians.
Those who idealize the independence of the state-university
are apt to forget that it has its own seamy side.
At the same time, to strengthen his appeal, the college
president is expected to create a larger clientele among
the public, and, for all these purposes, to organize the
alumni into a compact fighting force. This means that he
must be half the time traveling and making speeches.
The demands upon him for talk alone are usually far
in excess of any normal capacity for thinking; and it
would be an extraordinary man who, under all these conditions,
should preserve a high sincerity or a deeply
thoughtful attitude towards life.</p>

<p>All of this is the outcome of an expensive "democracy,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
based, we are told, upon broad conceptions of social
responsibility. How far the elevation of society is involved
in this democratic program I have tried to make
clear. In any case there would seem to be a need for a
few institutions of learning with the courage to be aristocratic.
An aristocratic college (or university, as the
case may be) would necessarily limit the scope of its work,
in range of courses and number of students, to what it
could do well upon the income at its command. Several
of our academic endowments might seem to be already
sufficient for maintaining a uniformly high standard of
very fair scope. An aristocratic institution of learning
would then be represented by an aristocratic faculty,
composed of men whose life and teaching rest upon the
conviction that exercise of intellect and cultivation of
taste produce a finer type of man. With the possible
exception of a few of the younger men, an aristocratic
faculty would be made up of men worthy of the rank
and salary of a full professor. In the aristocratic college
or university the competition for students would be replaced
by the competition of applicants for entrance; and
an institution which preserved its independence by thus
deliberately determining the scope of its work would have
the choice of the best. Admission to college would then
become what it might conceivably be expected to be, an
aristocratic privilege. Of course, an aristocratic institution
of learning could not hope to make a constant noise in
the world. It should none the less be an inspiring and
pervasive influence in the direction of a higher tone of
thought and morals for all of society.</p>

<h2>TRUST-BUSTING AS A NATIONAL PASTIME</h2>


<p>A German economist recently visiting the United
States was asked to explain how Germany's policy
toward industrial combinations differed from ours. He
said the difference that struck him most was that Germany
did not go about solving the problem through legislation
in the same light-hearted way that we seemed to. Perhaps,
he added, this is because the old fashioned view still
prevails in Germany that laws once enacted are to be
rigidly and impartially enforced. He continued, that
beyond amending her corporation law to insure that actual
assets should bear a constant relation to nominal capital,
to impose personal liability upon promoters and directors
for losses due to untrue or misleading information which
they might circulate, and to punish severely all forms of
unfair competition, Germany had refrained from legislating
on the subject. Nothing, he pointed out, like our
anti-trust act,&mdash;to say nothing of our New Jersey seven-sister
laws or our pending federal five-brother bills,&mdash;was
to be found in German legislation. On the contrary,
he asserted, combination agreements fixing prices and
controlling outputs are enforced by German courts as
readily as any other contracts, and the dissolution of a
combination like the Westphalian coal cartell would be
regarded not as a matter for public rejoicing, but as a
serious blow to national prosperity. He did not maintain
that Germany had solved the trust problem, but said that
her attitude was well described as one of "watchful
waiting."</p>

<p>To American statesmen the policy of Germany must
seem weak and pusillanimous to a degree. They have
become so habituated to the thought that "the anti-trust
act is the <i>magna charta</i> of our business liberties," that
attorneys-general and members of Congress vie with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
another in the race to add fresh victims to the list of
busted trusts to the credit of the dominant political party.
Presidents "point with pride" to the number of prosecutions
carried to a successful conclusion during their administrations.
If the zeal of the department of justice
seems to flag, Congress creates special committees to
investigate the steel trust or other suspected combination,
and thus a healthful rivalry is maintained which not only
keeps the names of the "busters" prominently before the
public, but supplies an unending stream of near facts for
our newspapers, ever fearless champions of truth and
justice.</p>

<p>Exhilarating as is this national pastime of trust-busting,
the latest legislative proposals in Congress may well give
pause even to the most ardent. Four bills have been
seriously put forward which if enacted would make criminal
many of the most common practices of American
business men. The climax is reached in a clause in one
of these measures that specifically makes it a crime for
business men "to make any agreement, enter into any
arrangement, or arrive at any understanding by which
they, directly or indirectly, undertake to prevent a free
and unrestricted competition among themselves or among
any purchasers or consumers in the sale, production or
transportation of any product, article, or commodity."
Under this clause California orange growers who join
together for the grading, packing and marketing of their
fruit would be parties to a criminal conspiracy. Milk
farmers who maintain coöperative creameries would be
equally culpable. Labor organizations restraining the competition
of their members in the sale of their labor are condemned.
This bill, if enacted and rigidly enforced would
make of business a <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>, and
bring us back to the atomic stage of our industrial development.
That such ill-considered legislation will be enacted
is highly improbable, but its serious proposal invites a
sober reconsideration of our whole trust policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>The first aspect of the present situation that must strike
the impartial observer is the inconsistency of the policy
we are adopting toward our railroads and other common
carriers. Since 1887 these businesses have been subject
to regulation through the Interstate Commerce Commission,
justified on the ground that for them competition is
not an adequate means of control, and that unless their
monopolizing greed is subjected to rigid regulation, the
interests of the public must suffer. That these businesses
are natural monopolies of organization, that is, businesses
that can be most efficiently and economically administered
as single or closely combined organizations in each of the
localities to which they minister, every economist would
agree. Competition in rates among railroads is undesirable
because it means costly and destructive rate wars
that can only end in rate agreements, tacit or open.</p>

<p>The policy of empowering the Interstate Commerce
Commission to fix rates, and thus secure reasonableness
and stability, is thus sound public policy. Amendments
to the interstate commerce act, giving the commission a
similar power over express rates and telegraph and telephone
rates, where competition is also absent or self-destructive,
have been made or should be made.</p>

<p>But while we are committed to this policy of regulated
combination of common carriers, we still apply to them
the Sherman act prohibiting combinations! Without
any attempt to decide or even discuss whether the combinations
into which the railroads have entered (the lease
of the Southern Pacific by the Union Pacific, for example)
make for economy and efficiency, the Attorney-General
feels compelled by the law which he is bound to administer,
to search out such combinations and force their dissolution.
No well informed railroad man would maintain
that any benefit redounded either to the public or to the
railroads by forcing the Southern Pacific and the Union
Pacific apart. Yet the Attorney-General congratulates
himself on the achievement, and public opinion approves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
because it is clear that the process was both costly and
painful to the railroads themselves. That what is bad
for the railroads must be good for the rest of us seems to
be the popular logic of the matter.</p>

<p>The most recent triumph of the department of justice,
in this field, is the forcing apart of the telephone and
telegraph monopolies. That these businesses can best
be operated in combination, is obvious to anyone who has
given any thought to the character of the services they
render. Receiving and delivering telegrams by telephone
add greatly to the efficiency of the system, not only because
of the saving of time, but because of the multiplication
of offices from which either telephone calls or telegrams
may be despatched. In many localities the same
poles may be used for stringing both kinds of wires.
Finally, on the administrative side, the opportunity for
saving through concentration of management is considerable.
At the same time that the Attorney-General was
effecting this divorce, the Postmaster General was urging
the advantages not only of having these two businesses
combined, but of having both managed by the
government in connection with the postal service. As
has been well said, if the Postmaster General is right
in advocating the operation of both the telegraph and
long-distance telephone businesses by the post-office, the
Attorney-General cannot be right in thinking the dismemberment
of the telegraph-telephone combination was in
the line of wise public policy.</p>

<p>It has long been clear to thoughtful citizens that as the
policy of regulating natural monopolies is perfected, the
policy of prohibiting combination in this field of enterprise
should be abandoned. No such amendment of the anti-trust
act is, however, included among the trust bills now
before Congress! They continue to ignore the distinction
between natural monopolies and ordinary businesses, and
to force upon both the <i>form</i> of competition; although, as
regards the former, the reality has long been notoriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
absent. Under the law as applied by the Supreme Court,
it is still criminal for the railroads to enter into rate agreements.
That they do enter into such agreements, however,
is tacitly recognized even by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, in entertaining from them a collective
demand for a five per cent increase in rates. No wonder a
German visitor is led to remark upon the contrast his
country presents, where the old fashioned view still prevails
that laws should be enforced!</p>

<p>As combination in the railroad, telegraph and telephone
businesses is a perfectly normal economic development,
conducing to the public interest rather than opposed to
it, so it is far from proven that combinations among manufacturers,
such as are freely permitted in Germany, are
not often advantageous. The steel industry may be
used to illustrate the argument. Here is a branch of business
in which concentration and large scale production
make for economy, until a scale of operations is attained
calling for millions of dollars of capital and thousands
of employees. The Carnegie Steel Company, the Jones-Laughlin
Steel Company, the Illinois Steel Company, all
grew up under highly competitive conditions, and each
attained a gigantic size without passing the point where
enlarging the scale of operations continued to make for
economy in production. But when an industry is of such
a character that success necessitates the investment of
millions of dollars in each competing aggregation of producing
units, a situation is presented where the losses due
to unrestrained competition are correspondingly enormous.
In times of prosperity, each producing organization expands
to realize more fully the economies of large scale
production. Iron and coke properties are secured to
insure uninterrupted supply of raw materials; transportation
facilities are acquired, since the business is so large
as to require for its exclusive use fleets of vessels and
special railroad carriers; blast furnaces and rolling mills
are built in convenient proximity, to permit the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
of raw materials into finished products with least
expenditure of time and effort. This development is in
obedience to the laws of expanding trade. If the industry
is to be economically conducted, it must occur, and the
public interest demands that it shall occur.</p>

<p>A period of depression now ensues. If each of the competing
units pursues its own interest blindly, disregardful
of the general good of the trade, each will compete desperately
to secure the largest share of the diminished
trade. Prices will be recklessly cut. It is better to operate
mines and mills at low profits, at no profits, or even at a
loss, than to have mines and mills shut down, the properties
deteriorate, and the skilled labor force that has been
slowly drawn together dispersed far and wide over the
country. There is thus no limit short of actual bankruptcy
to which the competitors will not find it to their interest
to go so long as they remain competitors. But why should
they carry their competition to such reckless lengths?
Will it not be better for each and for all to produce moderately
at low profits until the depression has passed, and
conserve all the producing machinery for the time when
business will revive, as it surely will revive, and all will
again be needed? Is such combination to restrain competition
opposed to the interest of the whole community?
What useful purpose, after all, is served by forcing large
numbers of steel plants into bankruptcy in every period of
depression, with the result that the machinery for production
becomes quite inadequate to meet the demand when
prosperity returns, and prices are forced to levels as unreasonably
high as they were unreasonably low during the
depression? Instead of having steel either prince or pauper,
is it not better to have steel a contented and moderately
prosperous citizen at all times? It is contended
that this life and death competition makes for more rapid
improvement in productive methods, but does it? Under
a regime of regulated combination, each producing unit
is still under strong pressure to cut down its expenses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
production, and to make its profits by that much larger.
Is there any real evidence that improvements in methods
have not been introduced as rapidly since the steel trust
was organized in 1901, as they were before? In that
period the open hearth process has been substituted on a
vast scale for the Bessemer process. The Steel Corporation
has spent millions of dollars in developing its plants at
Gary to the highest efficiency yet known in the industry.
Its smaller rivals have been equally active. Although in
many lines prices have been steadied, and run-away
markets in either direction prevented, there have been as
eager efforts to improve on existing methods, and to concentrate
production at the points best fitted for it, as there
ever were before.</p>

<p>There are, of course, considerations to be urged on the
other side. If allowed to combine to prevent disastrously
low prices, steel manufacturers will be under temptation
to take advantage of the situation by imposing unreasonably
high prices. "When producers reach for one
another's hands, let consumers guard their throats!"
If such combination is to be tolerated, it must be under the
restraining influence of a strong federal commission that
will enforce publicity, will prevent unfair and oppressive
methods toward non-members of the combination, and
will be prepared as a last resort to ask Congress for authority
to prescribe reasonable prices in exceptional cases,
just as the Interstate Commerce Commission has been
given authority to regulate in the public interest the
charges of common carriers.</p>

<p>The objection most strongly urged against such a policy
in high quarters is that it means "regulated monopoly"
and that monopoly is intolerable. There are three possible
policies which government may apply to business: that
of enforced competition, that of regulated competition,
and that of regulated monopoly. The bill that we have
criticized would enforce competition by penalizing every
slightest departure from it in the direction of coöperation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
This is so obviously not in harmony with the coöperative
spirit of the day, that the latest <i>pronunciamento</i> from
Washington declares in favor not of "enforced" competition
but of "regulated" competition. Regulated competition
is a policy on which all may seemingly unite,
but there is wide difference of opinion as to what it will
ultimately lead to. Those who consider regulated monopoly
intolerable believe that in all lines of business, provided
that small business men are protected from unfair
and oppressive methods of competition on the part of
their larger rivals, that a reasonable amount of publicity
is required, and that artificial methods of bringing about
monopoly are prevented, competition will remain a dominant
force. They make light of the alleged economies of
combination and view the whole trust movement as the
offspring of monopolistic greed and the profit-hunger of
the promoter and high financier. Those who believe that
in other lines of business than the recognized natural
monopolies, all embracing combinations would be able
to produce more efficiently and therefore sell more cheaply
than smaller producing units, think that regulated competition,
at least for these lines, must develop in the long
run into regulated monopoly. Instead of regarding regulated
monopoly as intolerable they view it as natural and
inevitable. While they admit that the superiority of large
combinations cannot be proved from American experience,
since regulated competition is only just beginning to have
a fair trial here, they point confidently, in support of
their theory, to what is going on in Germany. In view
of this diversity of expert opinion, it would seem to be
the part of prudence to give regulated competition a
fuller trial before going in either for enforced competition,
on the one hand, or regulated monopoly, on the other.</p>

<p>As a step toward a wiser solution of the combination
problem, than the blind condemnation and prohibition
of all combinations, which has thus far dominated American
legislation, the proposal to create an Interstate Trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Commission now before Congress merits the support of
all classes. Such a commission could aid materially in the
enforcement of the anti-trust act, and should therefore be
favored by the trust-busters. It could pass on the plans
of business men before they enter upon them, and thus
give at least negative aid in avoiding arrangements that
might be held unlawful. Finally, it could collect the information
necessary to a wise decision between our present
policy of prohibiting combinations and the German policy
of permitting them, subject to a policy of "watchful waiting"
on the part of the government.</p>

<p>It is indicative of the present state of mind of our public
men that the very committees of Congress which are
considering the creation of such a commission, are considering
at the same time measures that would largely prevent
it from accomplishing the good that is to be expected
from it. It is earnestly to be hoped that Congress may be
induced to content itself at this time with creating a competent
trade commission. If it is not prepared expressly
to exempt from the operation of the anti-trust act the
common carriers subject to regulation by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, may it at least refrain from making
that act odious as well as ridiculous, and leave to the
Supreme Court the task, on which it is so well advanced,
of giving it an interpretation that is at once clear and
reasonable!</p>

<h2>OUR GOVERNMENT SUBVENTION TO LITERATURE</h2>


<p>M. Paul Otlet, the Secretary of the Brussels International
Bibliographic Institute, places the
total annual book production of the entire globe at approximately
150,000 volumes per annum.</p>

<p>Senor Eduardo Ravarro Salvador, a distinguished
Spanish author, has compiled with greatest care statistics
of a similar nature which are printed in the <i>Madrid
Heraldo</i>, and his estimate quite closely confirms the other,
aggregating approximately a little over 160,000 for the
year 1911.</p>

<p>A dozen years ago, when book production was smaller
than today, Mr. Percy L. Parker, in the <i>New York Independent</i>,
gave the total number of books issued by thirteen
countries in an average year as 77,250, which would
be not as large as the estimates of either Senor Salvador
or M. Otlet, but is nevertheless of use in confirming them,
and increasing the probability that a mean of the three
estimates may be quite substantially near to the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph B. Gilder, in an article in the <i>New York
Times</i>, for January 25, 1914, states that our Ambassador
to the Court of St. James, Mr. Page of the publishing firm
of Doubleday, Page and Co., said not long before departing
for his post, that American men spend less for books
than for neckties, and American women less than for the
buttons on their frocks. The same article quotes the
Boston bookseller, Mr. W. B. Clarke, who is Chairman
of the Executive Committee of the American Booksellers
Association, as saying that the per capita consumption
of books is less than of any other commodity.</p>

<p>Following Mr. Gilder's article, and using the statistics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of the <i>Statesman's Year Book</i>, as to population, and of the
<i>World Almanac</i>, as to book production in 1910, we find
that in Switzerland there was one book printed for every
872 population; in Japan one to 1,224; in Germany one
to 2,075; in France one to 3,809; in Great Britain one
to 3,808; and in the United States one to 7,295. In 1911
our showing was not quite so good.</p>

<p>According to statistics prepared for the <i>World Almanac</i>,
and to sources indicated above, and others, the number of
books issued annually in the United States varies in late
years but little either way from 10,000. It would appear
that the United States issued roughly only about six per
cent of the total, and if we deduct new editions and translations,
only about four per cent of the total.</p>

<p>Further, by an examination of these various and
varying statistics from the best experts, it is evident that
little Switzerland, which is scarcely one-eighteenth the size
of our State of Texas, and whose population is less than
one-twenty-fifth that of the United States, publishes more
than three-quarters as many books per annum as we do;
in other words, ten times as many books per million inhabitants
per annum are published by Switzerland as by
the United States. In fact she leads the world in this
particular.</p>

<p>By similar analysis, we find that the Scandinavian
countries, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, which in book
production are next in rank to Switzerland, have an output
of about six times ours. Germany, France, the British
Empire, Holland, Italy, Austria greatly surpass us, all
running, per million of population, from three and one-half
to five times our output. Roumania, with one-thirteenth
our population, publishes one-fourth as many
books; Japan with slightly more than half our population,
publishes four times as many; in other words, eight times
as many per million of population; but a large number of
these are pamphlets: so instead of publishing in percentages
eight times as many, she really issues an average of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
between three and four times as many, which makes our
showing even then bad enough.</p>

<p>In the density of our ignorance, we sometimes think
and speak of Russia as a benighted country, forgetting
that in her middle and upper circles, she is vibrant with
intellectual and artistic energy. In book production,
even though the showing on her side is distorted by the
countless millions of her ignorant peasant class, who number
about 79 per cent of her population, we find that she
produces two and three-quarters times as many books as
we do, and has a population only one and two-thirds
times larger. In other words, she materially exceeds us
in book production.</p>

<p>This leaves us to seek in Spain the only one of the
civilized nations of the entire globe that publishes so few
books per million of population per annum as we do; and
it is questionable whether we are able to hold the lead
over even her: for an analysis of the statistics of both
Otlet and Salvador places us slightly behind united Spain
and Portugal, the figures for the two being given in conjunction.
Beneath these there is no lower depth.</p>

<p>Germany produces more books than any other nation in
the seven highly creditable classes of educational, arts
and sciences, <i>belles lettres</i>, theology, medicine, voyages,
and law.</p>

<p>Italy holds first rank in political economy; France in
history, poetry and drama; and the United States ties
France for first place in one item only, books on sport.
That is our best bid for a premier place.</p>

<p>The <i>Publishers' Weekly</i>, the semi-official organ of the
book trade, in its issue of Jan. 30, 1904, contains the following
statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The great decrease in all the more serious departments of
literature, as well as in some of the lighter ones, is a curious and
unexplainable condition of our book production. Scientific
and philosophical writings are as conspicuous through their
absence as are the simply amusing books.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, this backward condition of America's book
production is a new situation that has existed for a generation
only. That this is so, is shown in various ways, but
particularly in the parlous condition of the retail bookselling
trade. A generation ago, when our population
was a little less than one-half what it is today, there were
in the United States, it is estimated, between three and
four thousand booksellers carrying fairly good stocks of
books representative of history, light science, economics,
art, biography, travel, poetry, essays, fiction and <i>belles
lettres</i> generally.</p>

<p>There are less than fifteen hundred booksellers left, and
this number is steadily being diminished through withdrawals
from business. Yet on January 9, 1914, the Secretary
of the American News Company told the House
Committee on Post Office that the country contains
nearly a hundred thousand news stands.</p>

<p>Since there were three or four thousand bookstores,
not only has the population of the country more than
doubled, but the general average of wealth has increased
markedly, being quite four times what it was then: so that
by good rights the three or more thousand booksellers
of that day should have increased three-fold or over, to
at least ten thousand, instead of diminishing by more
than one-half.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If it be true, as has been repeatedly asserted, that a good
bookstore, well stocked and intelligently managed, performs
an educational work in any community only slightly,
if indeed at all, less important than that done by its schools,
colleges, libraries or churches, this deplorable condition
of affairs merits serious attention.</p>

<p>The reason for the situation is not far to seek: though
not even its existence, let alone its cause, is as generally
known as it should be. Yet the cause seems plainly and
definitely determinable. To arrive at it, we must turn
from book production to another printing-trade industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
that has waxed in the United States as book production
has waned. Forty years ago less than ten million copies
of periodicals, exclusive of newspapers, were published
annually. Today it is estimated that there are published
over seven-and-a-half billion, and of this quantity more
than one-half gets distribution through the mails. These
extra hundreds of millions of periodicals would seem to
mean as many tens of millions fewer good books; and that
seems to be virtually the sole cause of the disappearance
of the books.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On June 23, 1874, there was approved an act of Congress
establishing a pound rate of postage on mail matter
of the second-class&mdash;newspapers and periodicals. At first
this rate was three cents a pound for magazines, and two
for newspapers. Soon it was lowered to two cents for
each, and still later, becoming operative on July 1, 1885,
the rate was reduced to only one cent per pound for each.
The cost of service rendered then and every year since,
is many times that amount: at present it is estimated
by various experts and commissions as running from
6-1/2 cents to 12 cents per pound.</p>

<p>The effect of that law is emphatically shown in the
following table giving amounts of second-class mail
(periodical literature) carried by the Post Office Department
at various dates.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="amounts of 2nd class mail">
<tr><td>For</td><td>1875</td><td>(first year law was operative) 40,000,000</td><td>pounds</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>1880</td><td align="right">61,000,000</td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>1890</td><td align="right">204,000,000</td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>1900</td><td align="right">450,000,000</td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>1913</td><td align="right">1,096,000,000</td><td>"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>At this rate, within less than ten years, if the law is not
changed, this output will have increased to more than
<i>two billion pounds</i> per annum.</p>

<p>Evidently giving to periodical literature this service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
at one cent per pound, $20. per ton, the cost being eight
or ten times as much, has been simply a subvention, and
a very effective one. Although we publish few books as
compared with other civilized nations, we issue more
periodicals than all other nations put together, and half
as much again: for we publish sixty per cent of the periodical
literature of the entire globe.</p>

<p>The United States, according to the report of the Third
Assistant Postmaster General for January, 1914, handled
in the second-class mail, during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1913, over five thousand million copies of periodicals&mdash;more
than fifty for each man, woman and child in
the United States&mdash;enough to make more than 2,600
train loads of ten fully loaded cars per train. And this
does not take into consideration the enormous number
of copies of daily newspapers and other periodicals which
are circulated outside of the mails, by carriers, newsdealers
and others.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Underlying this megalosaurus-like development, is the
factor that carriage by the government at the nearly free
rate of one cent per pound, covers not only the literary
product but the advertising material which has been
the determining factor in this marvellous increase. At
the time the pound-rate law first became operative, magazines
were few in number, and contained little advertising
and much good literature; but the pound-rate law gave
birth to a new kind of magazine issued at less than cost
for the revenue to be derived, because of the immense
circulation possible under the subvention, from its advertising
pages; <i>and their advertising pages generally weigh
more and cost the government more to transport, than do
their literary pages</i>.</p>

<p>To increase this revenue, circulations were forced by
methods that directly violated the law, and these methods
are still being used. Premiums were given to an extent
that led to an investigation by the Post Office Department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
and it was found (Third Assistant Postmaster General's
report, Dec. 1, 1911, p. 39) that in one case four-fifths
of the subscribers went for the premium, the publication
being worth nothing except as an advertising medium
because of its large circulation&mdash;a circulation with which,
despite the government subvention, literature had nothing
to do. Another periodical, weekly and agricultural,
forced by premium 122,000 subscriptions out of 143,000;
another 41,000 out of 53,000.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of needless growths of this sort.
As an instance, there are published in the United States
some eighty-six banking periodicals. The Secretary of
the American Bankers' Association, when asked how
many of these were needed, replied: "From three to six,
and the other eighty are 'leg pullers.' They live in
great part by sandbagging advertising out of financial
interests."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dr. Talcott Williams, at the session of the American
Historical Association at Washington a few years ago,
said that one hundred years earlier, the aggregate weight
of one copy of each issue of an ordinary city daily for a
year was about ten pounds; fifty years later it was twenty-five
pounds; twenty-five years later it had become fifty
pounds; and when he spoke it was a hundred and twenty-five
pounds; while in some instances the Sunday editions
alone weigh more than that. How much of it is published
to the real advantage of the community?</p>

<p>Upon careful consideration, it seems evident that at
first the law diverted the patronage of the reading public
from books to the higher-priced and more respectable
magazines, those so priced that their sale at the published
rate would be possible even if the advertising were a minor
consideration; that next, the twenty-five cent issues cut
the ground from under these older and higher-priced ones;
that then rapidly appeared the fifteen-cent ones, and next
the ten-cent ones&mdash;all so expensive to make that only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
the great volume of advertising rendered the low price
possible; and that now the five-cent issues are, in their
turn, no less rapidly displacing the ten-cent ones. Swift's
doggerel tells the tale:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, naturalists observe, a flea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has smaller fleas that on him prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these have smaller still to bite 'em;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so proceed <i>ad infinitum</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While this article has primarily to do with the decadence
of our literature, the economic side should not be
lost sight of.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, the expense
account of the Post Office Department amounted to over
$260,000,000. The second-class mail supplied nearly
two-thirds of the tonnage, and cost more than one-third
of the total aggregate of expense, but the revenue paid
by its publishers amounted to just under $10,000,000, as
against the cost of over $86,000,000.</p>

<p>To make up for the loss thus incurred, the first-class
mail&mdash;the letter mail, which weighed only about one-fifth
as many pounds, had to supply $175,000,000 of
revenue from a service costing the government less than
$100,000,000. That is to say, the letter mail paid eighteen
times as much revenue as the second-class mail, and
weighed but one-fifth as much.</p>

<p>There were carried the past year very nearly two
billions of postal cards which produced a revenue of
nearly $20,000,000. The weight of these was only about
12,000,000 pounds. <i>Twelve</i> million pounds of postal
cards therefore produced almost exactly twice as much
revenue as <i>one thousand</i> million pounds of publishers'
second-class mail.</p>

<p>Averaging all in all, first-class mail costs at most not
quite four times as much per pound as second-class mail,
and pays eighty-four times as much.</p>

<p>In other words, each time that one of the forty or fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
million users of the first-class mail puts a two-cent stamp
on a letter, one cent pays for the service rendered, and
nearly all of the other cent is taken by the Department to
give the "special privilege" of service at one-eighth of
cost, to less than thirty thousand periodical publishers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Is it any wonder that new periodicals have begun their
career in the United States at the rate of more than ten
a day for every day, Sundays and holidays included, of
the past fifteen years? Fortunately, however, the death
rate is nearly as great as the birth rate; but since those
that persist are the selected growths, there is, as we have
seen, a tremendous annual increase.</p>

<p>One expert estimates that the total number of books
published in the world since the invention of printing is
some fifteen millions, and another, more modest, places
the figures at between ten and twelve millions. Assuming
for each book a first edition of one thousand copies, a
somewhat common issue, we should have from ten billion
to fifteen billion copies of <i>all</i>. In other words, there are
issued in the United States <i>each year</i> from one-half to
three-quarters as many copies of periodicals as have <i>ever</i>
been published in the first editions of <i>all</i> books ever printed
by all the nations of the world.</p>

<p>There can be no deduction made from the general features
of the situation other than that the distribution of
this one class of merchandise at a practically free rate is
nearly the sole reason for this wasteful over-production.</p>

<p>When the pound-rate law was enacted, the distinct
purpose was announced that its effect should be educational.
The contrary is unmistakably the case. The
reading of the ten to twenty minute magazine article or
the skimming over of the Sunday paper, seems to have
become too often the limit of the intellectual activity of
our people of average education.</p>

<p>To carry the <i>Police Gazette</i> at a cent a pound while
charging eight times as much for a spelling book or Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
and then to claim that the law permitting this discrepancy
was enacted in the interests of education, is at least
edifying. Archbishop Hare in his bright little volume
<i>Guesses at Truth</i> once remarked that a very bad reason was
in effect next to a very good one.</p>

<p>Mr. J. N. Larned the very eminent librarian says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The so-called <i>newspaper</i> which interests itself and which
labors to interest its readers in the trivialities and ignoble occurrences
of the day&mdash;in the prize fights and mean preliminaries
of prize fights, the boxing matches, the ball games, the races,
the teas, the luncheons, the receptions, the dresses, the goings
and comings and private doings of private persons&mdash;making
the most in all possible ways of all petty things and low things,
while treating grave matters with levity and impertinence&mdash;with
what effect can such a <i>news</i>paper be read? I do not care
to say. If I spoke my mind, I might strike harshly at too many
whose reading is confined to such sheets, but I will venture so
much remark as this: That I would prefer absolute illiteracy for
a son or a daughter of mine, total inability to spell a single
printed word, rather than that he or she should be habitually a
reader of the common newspaper of America of today, and a
reader of nothing better.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Census Bulletin No. 57 for 1905, there
was spent in the preceding year in the entire country for
newspapers the enormous sum of $280,000,000, and for
all textbooks for use in both public and private schools,
sectarian and non-sectarian, and in all colleges, only some
$12,000,000! More than $23 spent for ephemeral literature,
much of which debases the literary taste of the community,
for each dollar spent for literature whose function
was technically educational.</p>

<p>To get a further idea of the literary pabulum that the
government subvention is creating for us, let us consider
an average magazine of the so-called popular sort. Someone
defines it as follows:</p>

<p>"A magazine is a small body of literature, entirely
surrounded by advertising. In this respect, it resembles
a railroad ham sandwich with the advertising bread cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
very thick and the literary meat in especially thin slices.
The situation is well summarized when Dooley says:
'Hinnessy, mon, last night on my way home from wurruk
I bought one of them popular magazines expectin' after
I had eaten me supper and put on me slippers, and lighted
me pipe, to sit down for a quiet avenin's enjoyment looking
over the advertisements, and do you know, mon,
twinty-five per cent of the dommed thing was just nothing
but "litherachoor."'"</p>

<p>The magazine frequently gives great prominence to
pictures of actresses&mdash;doubtless by favorable arrangements
with their managers. With these may appear an
article with an alliterative title, showing How Cleveland
was Cunningly Conned; How Placid Philadelphia's Putridity
was Purged; Why Denver went to the Devil; etc.
Then may follow an article explaining how our reporter
Wily Willie went under "<i>Jawn Dee's</i>" window and, by
making a noise like an extra dividend, secured an interview
with him. Then a trifling poem or two, and a long continued
dry-as-dust serial story, which serves in some
measure as the talcum powder to disinfect, so to speak,
the rest. Then may follow a Retraction article, showing
that whereas we stated in our latest issue that an emissary
of the Standard Oil Co. was responsible for the Chicago
Conflagration by sneaking up behind Mrs. O'Leary's cow
and sticking a pin into her while she was being milked,
we wish to inform our readers that we are now convinced
that this was incorrect. Further investigation shows that
the Standard Oil Co. was entirely innocent. It was an
employee of the Packing House Trust who was guilty of
the dastardly deed. Then perhaps will follow a Passionate
Personal Appeal from the publisher for subscriptions to
about $10,000,000 worth of stock of the Magazine Company.
(Send in any sum from $1 up, use the corner
coupon.) All of this will be encased in a gaudy, if not neat,
cover bearing a design showing a girl's face and some of
her form. If you want to see the rest of that, look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
corset advertisements inside. An old lady lately said that
when she read her modern magazine, she felt that she
had been to an undress party where the men all came in
their "<i>unions</i>" and the women in their "<i>nemos</i>." Then
will follow advertisements of soaps, soups, shoes, massage
creams and a thousand other articles.</p>

<p>As illustrating another abuse that results from the
pound-rate privilege: Let me refer to some periodicals
that are light in weight; certain small magazines, for example,
weigh but a fraction of an ounce, and the government
must distribute many of them in order to secure one
cent. We have in our possession a little Farm Journal so
light that it takes forty copies to make a pound. As it is
published monthly, not until the Post Office has served a
subscriber with this journal for three years and four
months, will it get as much as a single cent for the entire
service.</p>

<p>And the government carries this kind of literature, advertising
and all, at one cent a pound&mdash;$20 per ton, and
charges for books eight cents per pound&mdash;$160 per ton,
and for the social-letter and business mail, 84 cents per
pound, $1680 per ton!!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bryan's philosophy was sounder than it sometimes has
been, when he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Supreme Court has described <i>unjust taxation as larceny
in the form of law</i>. If one citizen is compelled by law to pay ten
dollars for the support of the government where he ought to
only pay five, and under the same law a neighbor is required
to pay but five where he should pay ten, the law which causes
this inequality simply transfers five dollars from one man's
pocket to another's.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then a law which is each year taking over seventy-five
million dollars of net profit, above cost of service, from the
ninety-three million people who benefit from letters, in
order to give the thirty thousand periodical publishers
service for ten million dollars which costs <i>many</i> times that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
sum, is certainly not merely petty larceny or grand larceny,
but larceny that is absolutely grandiose.</p>

<p>To illustrate: One publishing company, it is reported,
made last year a net profit of over two million dollars.
Their postage was about $650,000, and it cost the government
over $4,500,000 to handle the output. Moreover,
more than $11,000,000 of advertising was borne on the
pages of those publications, and for it the company also
received virtually free distribution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Had a special privilege as great as this of the second-class
mail rate been enjoyed at national expense by any
class of citizens other than its publishers, the publishers
would not have permitted it to exist a year. Yet the loss
has long been well known to post-office officials and members
of Congress, though for a time it was kept from the
knowledge of the public, because practically the sole
means the public has had of obtaining the knowledge,
has been through the columns of journals that enjoy the
privilege. The <i>North American Review</i> for February, 1908,
had a most scathing article by Professor Munroe Smith,
entitled <i>The Dogma of Journalistic Inerrancy</i> that illustrated
this situation forcibly.</p>

<p>No lobby sent to Washington in furtherance of corrupt
legislation has ever been more persistent or dealt less
fairly with both legislators and public than the lobby
that has worked for retention of the second-class mail
rate. Some able editors have been accused of hunting
very jealously for other people's pulls while maintaining
a pretty heavy one of their own.</p>

<p>And the ceaselessly increasing monthlies of mammoth
circulation that so nobly, though with somewhat of iteration,
harp upon the graft of our plutocrats, our patent
medicine manufacturers, our frenzied financiers, our food
trusts, our fraudulent insurance officials&mdash;is it possible
that none of their diatribes, worthy though they may be,
are never to be directed against themselves? Let us hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
that some of these public-spirited citizens so patriotically
intent upon ridding a much-suffering land of its various
forms of organized rapacity, may be led to see a great
light in connection with the one industry of this country
that is by law largely relieved from subjection to those
competitive forces to which producers and distributors
of all other articles are keenly alive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may in time realize the truth of Emerson's remark
that "though no checks to a new evil appear, the checks
exist and will appear." For it is fast becoming notorious
that that advertising which is as the breath of life to all
those low-priced periodicals, has passed beyond the line
of marginal utility, and will not compensate the farther
sale of the magazines at less than cost of production.</p>

<p>A generation ago an English-born resident of Australia
was homesick. He thought how charming it would be to
see gamboling about his place an English rabbit. He
imported a pair. The soil and climate proved congenial.
They multiplied with enormous rapidity, and recently the
Australian government had a standing offer of £25,000 for
anybody who would devise some practical method of exterminating
the rabbit pest. Another settler, this time
a New Zealander of Caledonian birth, recalling to mind
the rugged beauty of the Scotch thistle, imported that,
and planted it at his doorway. The resultant development
was similar. There are hundreds and hundreds of
square miles of Scotch thistles in New Zealand. A
few years ago, a scientist imported for experimental purposes,
the gypsy moth, and caged it in his back yard in
one of the suburbs of Boston. A storm of wind and rain
wrecked the cage, and some of the moths escaped, with the
result that the state of Massachusetts has spent over three
million dollars in an effort to exterminate this pest that
is devastating its forests and bids fair to extend over the
entire United States with a resultant loss of countless
millions of dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>In legislation as in biology, it sometimes seems easier,
even with good motives, to spread noxious things than
useful ones. Our postal legislation has bred a swarm of
periodicals of which the vast majority are but a swarm of
pests.</p>

<p>In attacking them "at the source"&mdash;the cheap postage
by which we ourselves superficially seem to benefit, we
are entitled to no credit. On the contrary, while we
think our action is in favor of the good literature which
we try to serve, we still must own up to selfish motives.
The rank growth of worthless periodical literature tends
to smother the kind which we and a few of our colleagues
are trying to make. We think some of those colleagues
are standing in their own light when they advocate the
policy which breeds their worthless competitors. Periodicals
are like currency: the bad always drives out the good.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The publishers of this <span class="smcap">Review</span> hope that, without having
their motives misconstrued, they can add, from their own
experience, a very suggestive illustration of the main
contention of the foregoing article. Most of the readers
of the <span class="smcap">Review</span> are familiar with the Home University
Library, and some of them have praised it highly. In
England it has had a phenomenal success, in America
but a very moderate one. The American publishers are
constantly being told that in England it is on every railway
news stand, and asked why it is not here. The
answer is that here the flood of cheap periodicals leaves no
room for anything more substantial. The Home University
Library appeals to a popular constituency, and
there is a tremendous popular demand for it in England,
while in America there is none: its circulation here is
virtually restricted to the highly educated. The rank
and file of American readers have their tastes formed and
supplied by the Sunday newspapers and the cheap periodicals.
The idea of gathering a library of cheap books on
substantial subjects is virtually unknown among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>The worst feature of the whole case is that the enormous
demand for inferior stuff limits the field for writers who
can produce valuable matter, and consequently checks the
development of such writers. It would be as difficult to
produce a Home University Library in America as it
is to sell it. We have men of the requisite knowledge,
but our conditions do not attract them to cultivate the
literary art. Few of our scientific men and scholars are
writers, many more of those in England are. And as for
imaginative literature!</p>

<p>The cheap carriage of our periodicals was avowedly enacted
as a government subvention to literature. Why was
it not extended to books? In a year's shipments they do
not bulk nearly as large as periodicals. Are we forced to
the conclusion that at the present stage of evolution, a
helpful subvention to literature is beyond the power of a
pure democracy? If so, that is one reason for working all
the harder to raise the character of that democracy.
Would the withdrawal of the subvention be a good beginning?</p>

<h2>EN CASSEROLE</h2>


<h3><i>Special to Our Readers</i></h3>

<p>Many of our readers whom we have met have asked:
"Why don't you give us the names of your contributors?"
and we suppose that many whom we have
not had the pleasure of meeting have the same curiosity.</p>

<p>Well, in the first place, we wish our articles to be taken
on their merits, and each, so far as practicable, to carry
whatever authority the <span class="smcap">Review</span> as a whole may be able
to attain.</p>

<p>Next, among the popular fashions that we do not wish
to follow is that of exploiting names.</p>

<p>And finally, to be very candid, we need to profit by
whatever discussion may be aroused by speculation regarding
the authorship of the contributions.</p>

<p>Three months of anonymity, however, will be enough to
secure the first consideration, to lessen the objections inherent
in the second, and to give us most of whatever benefit
may be realized from the third; and therefore in such
lists of contents of previous numbers as are included in
our advertising pages, we shall indicate the authors.</p>

<p>Moreover our advertising pages will often include lists
of our most frequent contributors, and this may add zest
to such guessing at the authorship of contributions as
our readers may care to do.</p>

<p>Virtually all our contributors approve the anonymity,
perhaps partly because the names of most of them are so
well known as to make farther publicity a matter of
indifference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another question often put to us by friends is: "How
are you getting along?"</p>

<p>Well (again), as our title indicates, we entered upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the enterprise with our eyes wide open to the fact that
it could never be popular. Our only hope was that there
might be enough people with standards above the popular,
to support the undertaking. We still feel justified in
entertaining that hope. Of course some ludicrous failures
to understand what we are about have been forced upon
our attention, but not as many as we expected; and we
looked for more letters like the first one following, which,
we are surprised and glad to say, is the only one of the
kind we have received. All other dissent has been expressed
with intelligence and courtesy; and this is the
only occasion when our motives have been impugned.
We think we can trust our readers to understand why we
give the letter, and also the answer which the writer of
the letter did not expect us to send. The former seems
to us one of the most interesting and instructive contributions
it has been our privilege to present, though not
exactly for the reasons which make our other contributions
worth while. We are glad to repeat, however, that
the indications, so far, are that there is less of this sort of
thing about than we had supposed.</p>

<p>Here is the letter, in its essentials:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... This number contains some of the most insidious and
dangerous fallacies that it has been my fortune to peruse in
many years, and that are only intended to craftily instil into
the minds of the "rather large class" of people the erroneous
doctrines thus covertly inculcated by insinuations and to promote
the consequent satisfaction with their comparatively hard
lot and the necessity of contentment with their own condition
as well as with that of those who are subjects of a more forlorn
state.</p>

<p>Now I am going to make a proposition to you that will prove
conclusively that your object in publishing that <span class="smcap">Review</span> is
solely for the purpose last above enumerated, as I do not hope
that you will accept my proposition; and that the <span class="smcap">Review</span> is
supported by the capital of the men who are a part of the financial
oligarchy that is bent on ruining the poorer classes of this
country: I will write you an article in opposition to the <i>Irrepressible
Conflict</i> and the <i>Juggernaut of the Majority</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
will be written in as good a diction as either of those articles
and not more controversial in tone and style than <i>Irrepressible
Conflict</i>, and shall expect as much pay for it as either of
those two articles secured to their respective authors, or as much
as it is worth if those articles were produced by respective
members of the said oligarchy; and shall insist, if you refuse
to publish it, that it is the substance and doctrine of it that
make it unavailable and <i>not</i> the diction and style. I have a
right to ask this as the public press which claims to be the
leaders of public opinion, are teeming with just such articles
as these that I have criticised and are published for the <i>express
purpose</i> of leading me and the remainder of the public astray
on vital questions affecting the material interests of us all,&mdash;in
other words, there is a comprehensive and well formed conspiracy
among publishers of almost <i>all</i> newspapers and magazines
to do as I have said and to refuse to permit the other side
to be heard. I do not expect to ever get an answer to this
letter but I shall make just such use of the reticence and your
silence as my poor judgment teach me is legitimate and proper.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our answer was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... <span class="smcap">The Unpopular Review</span> is entirely the property of its
publishers.</p>

<p>It is not a forum for discussion, but a pulpit for the preaching
of what we believe to be sound doctrine. As you don't believe
our doctrine is sound, probably we would not believe yours is
sound: so your challenge to us to put it in our pulpit is of course
outside the case. You should send it to somebody of your own
way of thinking, or set up a pulpit of your own&mdash;into which we
certainly should not wish to challenge you to insert anything
of ours.</p></blockquote>

<p>A change of subject may be welcome.</p>

<p>If any of our readers have been expecting an article on
Psychical Research in this number, their disappointment
at not finding one may be somewhat assuaged by the
realization that the article in the first number was of four
times the average length. The apparent neglect here
however, is not real, but it has been impracticable to get
what we wanted. We hope to be more fortunate in the
future.</p>

<h3><i>A Specimen of "Uplift" Legislation</i></h3>

<p>Since the bull against the comet, there has probably
been no assertion of authority as absurd as one recently
furnished by our National Government. Yet there was
no attention called to it in the debate preceding the passage
of the act containing it, and we do not remember
seeing any notice of it in the press, although it was immense
enough and pitiful enough to justify Iliads.</p>

<p>For years, government&mdash;and no government more
energetically than President Wilson's&mdash;had been hammering
away at the trusts, especially those producing
petroleum, steel and tobacco. Yet petroleum, steel and
tobacco are not necessaries of life, nor have their prices
been rising as much as the prices of necessaries of life.
These have been rising more than anything else. What
has been done about them by the government that has
been destroying the trusts in other things? It has simply
gone out of its way to specially legalize a trust in these
things. In a bill providing money to fight trusts in comparatively
non-essential things, Congress specially exempted
from prosecution any trust that may be formed
by the farmers to raise the price of food. Other trusts
claim to lower the prices of their products, and sometimes
have done it; but our government has not merely authorized
the farmers to form trusts, to raise the price of
foods, but has specially authorized them, in the letter of
the law, to use methods denied to everybody else but wage-earners;
and this at a time when the one problem above
all others was how to lower the price of foods, and when the
high price was the one burden above all others on the poor.</p>

<p>This piece of imbecility was virtually a "rider" on the
trade-union-exemption rider, and was of course "playing
politics" to catch support for the principal rider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>A Model of Divinatory Criticism</i></h3>

<p>In our efforts to uphold the dignity of letters, of course
we intend that each of our contributions shall be as nearly
as possible a perfect example from its special field, and
ordinarily it would ill become us to suggest the possibility
of degrees of perfection. But our readers will, we trust,
find justification for our calling special attention to the
following model of divinatory criticism.</p>

<p>The fact that it has already passed the ordeal of the
Authors' Club, though a trifling derogation from its novelty,
is much weightier as a reason for presenting it for the
careful consideration of our readers. [Ed.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The subject is the proper interpretation of a familiar
lyric poem, which runs, in the <i>textus receptus</i>, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dr. Foster went to Gloucester<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a shower of rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stepped in a puddle up to his middle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never went there again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The question is, What does this poem mean? What
does it mean, that is, in its intimate and ultimate essence?
According to the conventional interpretation these lines
are didactic. Their higher import&mdash;what we may call
their spiritual center of gravity&mdash;is believed to reside in
a pragmatic moral conveyed, or at least adumbrated, in
the last line: "He never went there again." The idea
is supposed to be&mdash;remember that I am now speaking of
the conventional interpretation&mdash;that he never went
there again because he had learned wisdom by experience&mdash;the
annoying experience of the puddle. According to
this view the dominant note of the poem is not lyrical
feeling, but what literary critics are wont to call&mdash;usually
with a shade of contempt&mdash;ethicism. It is supposed to
be a sort of psalm of life&mdash;pitched to be sure in a minor
key, but essentially didactic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish to show you that this conventional interpretation
is altogether wrong. I shall try to prove that we have to
do here, not with a shallow didactic rime, not with a piece
of brain-spun ethicism, such as a common poetaster might
produce, but with a lyrical ballad of deeply felt tragic
import.</p>

<p>I call your attention, in the first place, to the singular
ambiguity in that famous last line. "He never went
there again." "Never went where?" one instinctively
asks. Are we to understand merely that Foster henceforth
avoided the particular puddle into which he had stepped,
or that he in after time discontinued his visits to Gloucester
altogether? This is evidently a question of vital
importance, and the poem at first does not seem to answer
it at all. In the absence of biographical data extraneous
to the text, we can only attack the problem by analytic
methods. Let us consider the only two possible hypotheses.</p>

<p>1. That Foster never went to Gloucester again. This
supposition is utterly untenable, because it is clearly inconsistent
with Foster's character, which can be read
from the poem itself with entire certainty. In the first
place, he was clearly a doctor of medicine. Had he been
a doctor of laws, or letters, or philosophy, there would
have been no special urgency in his call to Gloucester, and
he would surely have waited until the weather should
clear up. Secondly he was a youngish doctor. Had he
been an elderly practitioner he would not have gone himself,
but would have sent his assistant. Or perhaps he
would have telephoned that he would come immediately,
and would then have quietly waited for the rain to cease.
But our Dr. Foster "went"&mdash;went in a shower of rain.
From this we see, in the third place, that he was a man of
energy, capable of self-abnegation, dominated by a strong
sense of professional duty. Now can we suppose that
such a man would have renounced forever his practice in
Gloucester merely because he had stepped casually into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
puddle in a well meant effort to reach the place? The
supposition is an insult to his intelligence and to ours.
No doubt the incident of the puddle was humiliating, but
we do not read that there were spectators. In the absence
of specific evidence to the contrary we must assume that
Foster was alone. That being so, a man of his character
would surely have extricated himself from his unpleasant
dilemma, given vent to his emotions in language suited
to the occasion, and gone on his way. It is simply impossible
to believe that he can have taken from the puddle
such a deep and lasting chagrin that he would have been
willing to renounce forevermore his growing practice in
Gloucester.</p>

<p>2. We turn now to the other hypothesis, according to
which Mater Anser means merely that Foster never again
stepped in that particular puddle. This supposition makes
the whole poem trivial to the point of banality. Why
in the world should any man in his senses deliberately
step into a deep puddle a second time? Remember too
that it was raining at the time. The puddle did not exist
ordinarily, but was a transitory affair due to the freshet.
Had Foster chosen to come back the next day, there
would have been no puddle there, hence nothing to be
afraid of. To assume that a man of Foster's intelligence
would have retained through life a morbid dread of a mere
depression in the ground where he had once encountered
a puddle is contrary to all reason. Evidently we must
seek some other interpretation for that mysterious last
line, "He never went there again."</p>

<p>And now observe, please, a singular technical defect in
a poem which is otherwise technically perfect. I refer
to the dubious rime <i>puddle-middle</i>. There has never been
a time in the history of the English language, so far as I
know, when that was a tolerable rime. If puddle were of
French origin and had retained its French <i>ü</i>-sound, "He
stepped in a püddle up to his middle" might perhaps pass
muster. But <i>puddle</i> is not of French origin. It was this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
bad rime, coupled with the anatomical vagueness of the
phrase "up to his middle," which led me to conjecture
that the <i>textus receptus</i> must be corrupt. It is pretty evident
that Mater Anser originally wrote not "middle,"
but some word which was taken for "middle" by a pestilent
scribe. And what word can that possibly have been
but "noddle"? Perhaps a captious critic may object
that, as a matter of rime, <i>puddle-noddle</i> is not much better
than <i>puddle-middle</i>. But remember that in early English
o and u were often confused. It is altogether likely that
the word which we pronounce <i>puddle</i> was familiar to
Mater Anser's dialect as <i>poddle</i>. What she wrote was:
He stepped in a poddle up to his noddle.</p>

<p>In the light flashed on the poem by this recension of the
text, we penetrate at once the mystery of that last line,
"He never went there again," because he never went
anywhere again. He perished. His promising career came
then and there to an untimely end. We now understand
why it is that the career of Dr. Foster subsequent to his
memorable expedition to Gloucester has failed to interest
the Muse. There was no subsequent career.</p>

<p>I trust I have made it clear that Dr. Foster is the hero
of a tragical ballad. He is evidently a being of the same
order as Achilles and Siegfried&mdash;those dazzling heroes
of the Dawn who are destined to run a brilliant career
in the pride of their youthful strength, and then to meet
with an untimely end. It is true that Achilles and Siegfried
are invulnerable, except in one place, and that we
hear nothing of Foster's invulnerability. But if you look
closely you will find something in his case that is quite
analogous. The underlying idea of the invulnerability is
always simply this: That the hero is fated to die in one
particular way, and in no other. Now it is clear that
Foster was fated to die by water. Water was his enemy,
his fate. A pious mother had no doubt brought him up to
dread and avoid it. When he set out on that last journey
he of course took an umbrella, but his precautions did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
not end there. In view of the inclement weather he of
course felt the need of something to fortify the inner man,
but he durst not and did not drink water. He drank something
else. Just what it was we are not told, but it was
evidently something that made him a little unsteady on
his feet. And so, just as in the case of Oedipus, the very
precautions that he took to avoid his predestined fate
only served to precipitate it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I conclude by summing up briefly what my interpretation
does for the advancement of science.</p>

<p>1. It converts what has been supposed to be a rather
trivial didactic rime into a tragical ballad of heart-rending
pathos.</p>

<p>2. It removes the one serious technical defect of the
poem.</p>

<p>3. It accounts in a natural way for the oblivion which
has settled like a pall over the career of Dr. Foster after
his visit to Gloucester.</p>

<p>4. It enables us to connect Foster with the great heroes
of epic song.</p>


<h3><i>Some Deserving "Climbers"</i></h3>

<p>Language, like society, has to recruit its upper strata
from the lower. Here are some recent candidates.</p>

<p>I. The very eminent author of <i>The Baby and the
Bee</i> in this number puts into the mouth of one of the
characters the word "humans" as an equivalent for human
beings. The same use of it has been met elsewhere
in quarters of less dignity. Many of our readers must
have regretted the absence from the language of a single
word equivalent to <i>homo</i>. Is not "human" as a noun
worthy of being raised to that dignity?</p>

<p>II. Another new labor-saving locution has already
found its way into the Standard Dictionary, and seems
worthy of general recognition. The dictionary treats it
thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>thon, 1 thon; 2 thon, pron. sing. pl. [thon's, poss.; thon, obj.]
that one; he, she, or it; a pronoun of the 3rd person, common
gender; a contracted and solidified form of <i>that one</i>, proposed
in 1858 by Charles Crozat Converse, of Erie, Pennsylvania,
as a substitute in cases where the use of a restrictive pronoun
involves either inaccuracy or obscurity, or its non-employment
necessitates awkward repetition. The following examples,
first as ordinarily written, and afterward with the substitution
of the genderless pronoun, illustrate the grammatical
deficiencies of the English language in this particular and
the proposed method of removal: "If Harry or his wife comes,
I will be on hand to meet <i>him</i> or <i>her</i> (or whichever appears)."
"Each pupil must learn <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> own lesson." With the substitution
of <i>thon</i>; "If Harry or his wife comes, I will be on hand
to meet <i>thon</i> (i.e., that one who comes)." "Each pupil must
learn thon's lesson (i.e., <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> own)." Compare he'er,
him'er, his'er.</p></blockquote>

<p>III. A third applicant for the <i>cachet</i> is "near," not as a
preposition, but as an adjective signifying imitation or ineffective
approximation, as, near pearls, near lover, near
artist, etc., etc. It would at least often save several syllables,
and sometimes save a circumlocution. It seems
to have begun rather low down. We don't half like it,
and we were surprised to find it as far up as in an article
by an eminent professor in our present number. But there
it was, and it seems well on the way to full habilitation.</p>


<h3><i>Simplified Spelling</i></h3>

<p>The invitation in the January number for views on
Simplified Spelling has brought some interesting letters
from both sides. The best objections that we have seen
anywhere are the following:</p>

<p>(1) From an eminent professor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... This point, briefly, is whether the spoken language is the
only <i>entity</i>, so to say, to be considered in the case, and the written
language merely an effort to represent it, or whether the
written language is equally a reality for the purposes of civilization....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>I have just received a holiday greeting ... reading</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Harty Crismas Greetings.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The chain of frendship reaching far<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Links days that wer with days that ar.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For him [the sender] all written characters are absolutely
nothing but the effort to express spoken sounds, and he puts
anything on paper which he thinks will represent the sound he
wants most immediately for the reader's intelligence. If he is
right, if our written language is nothing but this, there should
be no delay in altering it radically.</p>

<p>But is my philological friend right? I think certainly not.
Since printing came to take a really large place in civilization,
the written word has been a <i>logos</i>&mdash;a direct means of representing
thought&mdash;quite as truly as the spoken. As an agency for
communicating thought between absent persons, for preserving
thought from one time to another, and even for communicating
the knowledge of a foreign tongue to a contemporary learner,
the written word actually exceeds the spoken in general importance.
And to a very large extent it does this <i>not</i> by representing
the sounds of the spoken word, but by representing the
idea through an independent convention. When I read the
word "choir" I do not think first that it represents the syllable
<i>kwiir</i>, and then that the syllable <i>kwiir</i> means a company of
singers. Some foreigners who have learned English orally
doubtless do go through this process; but those who have learned
it primarily by reading, or for reading, do not....</p>

<p>The participle <i>finished</i> has a certain real existence as a language
fact, undisturbed by the accident that it is now pronounced
<i>finisht</i>.</p>

<p>And this great entity, the written English language, the chief
medium of scholarship, literature, history, law, and even business
... is what it is proposed to change. Perhaps it should
be done; perhaps the times demand an heroic sacrifice of the
organ of scholarly and literary communication and tradition,
in the interest of increased efficiency on the part of the average
man for whom the language of scholarship and literature is
negligible. But we should not mistake the meaning of the
effort. It is not the mere effort to do better what we are doing
already&mdash;writing words so-and-so because they sound so-and-so;
for we are already doing nothing of the kind. It is the effort
to transfer English from the group where, with modern French
and other tongues, it now belongs,&mdash;the group of languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
whose history has differentiated a written and a spoken form,&mdash;to
the group represented by classic Latin and modern Italian,
whose (doubtless happier) history has kept the written form a
fairly accurate replica of the spoken....</p>

<p>The impression often prevails that those who hesitate to
commit themselves to the enticements of the Spelling Board
do so merely because the new spellings "look so queer." Of
course this very statement is a clumsy and unpenetrating way
of expressing the fact that the whole language psychology of a
<i>reading</i> generation is disturbed by the efforts in question.</p></blockquote>

<p>(II) From a lady:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This unspeakable spelling is history-destroying, tradition-annihilating,
and puts the veriest hind on a semblance of equality
with a person of elegance.</p>

<p>As Nietsche says: "Let us be free from moralic acid"!!</p></blockquote>

<p>Possibly to some tastes, a neck without a goitre would
be more "elegant" than a neck with one&mdash;or <i>tho</i> than
<i>though</i>.</p>

<p>(III) From a well-known author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The tendency of our English speech is constantly to "reform"
its Orthography! Witness the betterment between the spelling
of Chaucer and that of Shakespeare, and between that of Shakespeare
and that of the days of Queen Anne! Well then, granting
it to be the irresistible tendency of our Orthography to better
itself, why not permit it to go on in peace bettering itself? Why
assist Fate? Are our awful Spelling Reformers, like the impatient
young gentleman in Mr. Stockton's story, appointed to
the task of Assisting Fate?</p></blockquote>

<p>(IV) From a talented author and critic&mdash;a lady:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You must allow me, as an old friend of yours and a new
friend of the <span class="smcap">Review</span>'s, to protest against the introduction of
"reformed spelling" into a literary journal of a high class, which
is what we all consider the new venture. To many of us who
respect the English language as an inheritance, and are content
to leave its simplification to the slow erosion of time, pages like
those at the end of the <span class="smcap">Review</span> give positive pain.</p></blockquote>

<p>It would indeed be a hardened reformer who would not
feel the force of the foregoing objections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>To "Why assist Fate?" and "the slow erosion of time"
the answer is that the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i> has had its
day, and can hardly be regarded as open for discussion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the other side, we have received many letters favoring
the reform from the highest philological authorities:</p>

<p>(I) From a Johns Hopkins Professor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Serious study of the problem becomes the duty of every
thoughtful person.</p></blockquote>

<p>(II) From a Harvard Professor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A discussion of orthographic possibilities can hardly fail
to be enlightening. I do not much like the scheme you tentatively
advocate, but anything that reveals existing absurdities
and opens up new vistas is useful at this stage.</p></blockquote>

<p>(III) On the other hand, the Superintendent of Education
in one of the Canadian provinces, whose sympathies
are naturally British, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your simplified spelling appeals to me in preference to that
of the S. S. S. of London."</p></blockquote>

<p>The main differences are illustrated in (the S. S. B.
coming first) <i>tiem</i> and <i>tiim</i> for <i>time</i>, <i>doer</i> and <i>door</i> for <i>door</i>,
<i>tiping</i> and <i>tipping</i> for <i>tipping</i>.</p>

<p>(IV) A Nova Scotian, president of an important educational
institution, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your article on simplified spelling is a very courageous one&mdash;<i>for
an American</i>! Probably it has alredy brought upon you the
whips and scorns of the conventional journalist. In the Old
Country, scholars are accustomd to stand up against professional
journalists. Do you think you can do so with your new
scheme? I hope so, for it seems to me simple in principle, and,
on the whole, a good working basis. One is tempted, of course,
to ask why such inconsistencies as:</p>

<p>Allwaiz&mdash;Becauz.</p>

<p>Oonly&mdash;Molar.</p></blockquote>

<p>We accept the <i>aw</i> sound for <i>a</i> before <i>ll</i>, but probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
<i>awl</i> is better than <i>all</i>; and in <i>becauz</i> it should undoubtedly
be <i>aw</i>.</p>

<p>As to <i>molar</i>, we propose that a single vowel should
always, as generally now, be long at the end of a syllable.</p>

<p>The same correspondent continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, if long vowels are to be indicated by the doubling of
the letter, is there any need of doubling the consonant after a
short vowel?</p></blockquote>

<p>(V) Another correspondent joins in the same charge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It hardly seems logical to double a vowel to indicate its
lengthening and at the same time to double a consonant to
indicate the closing of a preceding vowel. It strikes me as rather
a clumsy artifice at best, and leads to some very cumbrous
forms, of which "annuthther," as you point out, is an extreme
instance.</p></blockquote>

<p>But, as just said, it is not proposed that always "long
vowels are to be indicated by doubling of the letter," but
only when the syllable is closed by a consonant. See also
the second paragraph of the following letter answering a
correspondent, which shows some aspects of the question
that may be worth presenting to other readers as well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thanks for your letter.... I wish all that I get on the
subject were equally sensible. At the same time, there are two
or three things that call for rejoinder.</p>

<p>When a consonant beginning a second syllable, is repeated
at the end of the preceding syllable, to prevent the vowel being
counted as long, the consonant is by no means "doubled" in
the sense that a vowel is doubled to make it count as long, or
as the terminal consonant is doubled in fall, call, etc.</p>

<p>In English spelling probably there cannot be carried out any
principle that won't land us somewhere into awkwardnesses
almost as great as "annuthther." That particular one, I have
no doubt, if ever adopted, would work into smaller dimensions,
which of course would have some elements of inconsistency.
There is no reason, however, why we should not use the methods
which lead to absurdities in that word, in hosts of other words
where they don't.</p>

<p>I shall never take any part in an attempt to add characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
to the English language. The only thing in that line it has done
since it began taking shape, is to get rid of two very useful ones;
and I don't believe it will ever move in the opposite direction.
My humble efforts will be concentrated on doing the best practicable
with those we have, though I wish Godspeed to everybody
who works for consistency and reasonableness, even if he
thinks he can introduce a new alphabet.</p>

<p>It is never going to simplify our language to introduce diacritical
marks. My little experience with French satisfies me
on that subject.</p>

<p>I am glad you agree with me as to dropping the <i>u</i> after <i>q</i>.</p>

<p>I am not sure about using <i>x</i> without a vowel preceding it
(<i>e. g.</i> xpense). Theoretically no consonant carries a vowel, but
<i>x</i> is pronounced as if there were a short <i>e</i> before it, though,
like any other consonant, it will take the color of any vowel.</p>

<p>I don't believe that I am going to be any farther reformed in
regard to vowels than <i>oo</i> in <i>door</i>, <i>ee</i> in <i>feel</i>, <i>aa</i> as suggested by
the British Society in "faather," <i>uu</i> in "suun" as also suggested
by them; and <i>ii</i> in "tiim," as suggested by me and probably
by others whom I don't know of. I only wish you would leave
your diacritics and new letters, and fight with me for these
vowels. There seems to be some hope in such a fight, as the
English Society is for all but the <i>ii</i>, and consistent people will
naturally work for their accepting <i>ii</i>; and as nobody that I am
aware of, in the direction of either body, is with you for new
letters and diacritics.</p></blockquote>

<p>To the same correspondent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your letter of the 5th is very suggestive.</p>

<p>I think one trouble between us is that you think it worth
while to strive for ideal perfection in spelling. If we attained
it, it would not stay put.</p>

<p>You say: "It seems to me simple arithmetic admonishes us
that we have to have new characters for the vowel sounds."
There are two reasons why we don't. One is that (<i>me judice</i>)
there is no use in seeking absolute perfection. Another is that
we can do with existing letters as much of the work as we need
to.</p>

<p>It may be "important" to "develop an alphabet in which
each character stands for a precise sound" but I haven't the
slightest idea that the English-speaking people will ever do it.</p>

<p>Of course all existing languages have come because "peoples
... drift so far apart in pronunciation as sooner or later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
to become almost unintelligible to each other," but printing
and facilities of communication are probably obstructing farther
movements in that direction, and I should not be surprised if
the present tendency were toward unity.</p>

<p>I am sorry you are one of the reformers who "believe that we
should go the whole way, or let things stay as they are." It
is not often that any reform goes the whole way, and I suspect
that we would be a good deal farther along if people of reforming
disposition would be content to go only so far as practicable.</p></blockquote>

<p>On one side, then, we have habit and sensitive associations,
and on the other side the facts which cannot be
denied by anyone who is thoughtful and educated (not
always synonymous terms) that the anomalies of English
spelling not only breed lawlessness in the juvenile mind,
increase the difficulties of education, and waste much
labor and expense in writing and printing, but also
seriously obstruct commerce, diplomacy, and the peace of
the world.</p>

<p>No wonder these opposing conditions produce the
frame of mind expressed to us by a leading city Superintendent
of Schools: "I abominate simplified spelling,
but I am in favor of it."</p>

<p>Now between this Scylla and this Charybdis, what is the
reasonable course?</p>

<p>We must regard two considerations too often ignored
by reformers, though they were insisted on by as great
an authority as Spencer. The first is that feeling, more
than reason, determines conduct; the other is that everything
is so inextricably connected with other things, that
raising one is like raising a strand of a net, which involves
raising many other strands with it. With this reform are
tangled up not only the feelings and habits illustrated in the
foregoing quotations, but all existing English literature,
including many thousand tons of it in electrotype plates.
All these obstruct a sudden reform. Must then the reform
be as gradual as that from Chaucer's spelling to ours?
Prophecy is dangerous, but we are inclined to think not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>We favor simplified spellings, but we don't want our attention
diverted by them from anything that we value
more, and we don't want to interfere with anybody's
Shakspere or Tennyson, any more than we want anybody
to interfere with ours. We are glad, however, when we see
the sign of a "Fotografer," or an announcement of a
"thru" train. We have no doubt that a large and increasing
number of people share both these sets of feelings,
and they seem to indicate the way out of the dilemma.</p>

<p>Now there's no question of intrinsic beauty between
the new forms and the old. Preference for the latter is
simply a matter of habit, but habit is stronger than intelligence;
and here, with the student, intelligence balks
at habit in a paradoxical way. In reading an impassioned
passage, he encounters a "<i>thru</i>"; his thoughts are not
only diverted to the spelling, but to the years of association
he may have with the problems concerning it. For
ourselves, the more we study it, if we meet it in literature
the more we "abominate" it, with the superintendent
already quoted; but the more we see it in advertisements
and other indifferent places, the more we are "in favor
of it"; and this we think is apt to be the experience of
those who really bring their intellects to the problem.
Nay, we even think that, in time, the younger portion of
the thinking people whose habits favor the old forms,
may perhaps come around to the new: for, after writing
the most radical of the new forms, as in the last number
of the <span class="smcap">Review</span>, we have been surprised at the way they
linger in the memory and seem for a while more habitual
than the old forms. This experience makes it seem probable
that if, for our children's sake, and for the sake of
the great causes already indicated, we were to condemn
ourselves for a few weeks, or possibly even a few days, to
the better forms, they would become more natural than
the worse.</p>
